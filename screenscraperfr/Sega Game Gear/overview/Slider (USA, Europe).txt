You play a hairy yellow guy that kind of looks like a pineapple; it's your job to go through the level painting all of the tiles. Unfortunately it's not as easy as just walking around and using your pink paint, because you are constantly having to avoid various enemies (dog-like characters, Pinocchio heads, KKK hoods, etc.) if you want to complete the level.
