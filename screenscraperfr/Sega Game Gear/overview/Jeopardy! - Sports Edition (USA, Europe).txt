Jeopardy! Sports Edition is a version of Jeopardy! replacing the puzzles with sports-themed puzzles (though the categories are still varied) and the characters with sprites of presumably fictional athletes. The Mega Drive version does not change anything else; the title and copyright screen are the same from Jeopardy! (but strangely removes Park Place Productions's logo); the Game Gear version does sport a new title screen.
