Inquisitive Smurf and Smurfette have broken the magic crystal and now they are being taken off to various parts of the world. Collect all the crystals to be found along your route. To reveal them, brave the sea-lions of the North Pole, the Indians of America, and the octopuses of the deep... Only after you have smurfed all these challenges and many others will you be able to return to the village.
