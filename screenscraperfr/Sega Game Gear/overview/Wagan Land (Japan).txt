Wagyan Land was only released in Japan, and is a slightly enhanced port of a 1989 Famicom game of the same name and was released as part of the Wagyan Land series.

Wagyan Land is a semi-educational title, comprised of both platforming segments and minigames such as shiritori (which is seen as the main reason no games in the series have seen western releases). The Game Gear port features redesigned levels to accommodate the smaller screen, a slightly altered plot and some powerups from Wagyan Land 2.
