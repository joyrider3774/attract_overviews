Batter Up, known as Gear Stadium in Japan, is a baseball game developed and published by Namco for the Sega Game Gear. It is a handheld entry in Namco's World Stadium series, itself inspired by the earlier Family Stadium series for the Famicom, whose first entry, Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, dates back to 1986. It has a two-player mode which makes use of the Gear-to-Gear Cable peripheral. An updated version titled Gear Stadium Heiseiban was released in Japan in 1995.
