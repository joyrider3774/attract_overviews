LISTEN UP, CRIME FIGHTERS!

The greatest comic book hero of all time, Radioactive Man, has been kidnapped...and it's up to yours truly to save the R-Man.

I'll put all my awesome super-powers to the best when I battle the slimy Swamp Hag, the evil Dr. Crab and the bad-tempered Lava Man. Once I wipe these villains out and restore Radioactive Man's powers, we'll take on the brains behind this ugly scheme, Brain-O The Magnificent.

So quit reading and buy this game OR ELSE. That's an order from Bartman, man!!!

-THIS LOOKS LIKE A JOB...FOR BARTMAN!
-WILL A BLAST OF COLD BREATH PUT THE FREEZE ON SWAMP HAG?
-THE TERRORS OF THE DEEP ARE NO  MATCH FOR THE MIGHTY BARTMAN!
-DANGER LURKS EVERYWHERE IN THE JUNKYARD!
-IT'S FIST AGAINST CLAW IN THE EVIL DR. CRAB'S LAIR!
