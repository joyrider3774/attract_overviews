The game is a shooting puzzler; there aren't a wide variety of power-ups to boost your shot powers, but there are various obstacles on the stage that can work for you (or against you). For example, you can shoot reflective blocks that bounce your shots around the room. You can look around the stages and think of the best way to finish the level based on the enemies and stage layouts. Enemies function differently, adding to the puzzle.
