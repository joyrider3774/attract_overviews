Crazy Faces is an unreleased Sega Game Gear game developed by The Kremlin and was due to be published by Domark. Had it been released, it would have debuted around 1993. SMSPower dumped a prototype of the game in April 2012.

Crazy Faces has the user push tiles around a screen in an attempt to make pictures in the fastest possible time. Pictures involve popular video game IPs owned by Domark at the time, as well as some by Sega (namely Sonic the Hedgehog). The prototype has no music.
