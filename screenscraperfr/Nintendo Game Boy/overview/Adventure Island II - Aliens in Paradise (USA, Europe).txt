Save your girlfriend from the menacing aliens

Fortunately, you have a little help. There are five kinds of friendly dinosaurs waiting to give you a lift. They're stuck in eggs that you'll need to crack open! Hidden eggs are scattered all over the islands. By finding and breaking them open, you might get a bonus, or even a secret way to the next island! Just don't eat the eggplant...

So hop on one of your dinosaur pals, and ride your way to Jeannie's rescue!
