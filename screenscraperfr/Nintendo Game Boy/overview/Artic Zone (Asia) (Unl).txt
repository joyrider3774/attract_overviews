The objective of the game is to remove all the blocks heading towards the Bear,
getting as high of a score as possible.

To remove blocks in this game, you need to fill in the gaps of each block to
form a rectangle.  This needs to be done before the set of blocks reach the
bear on the right of the screen, or you will have a Game Over
