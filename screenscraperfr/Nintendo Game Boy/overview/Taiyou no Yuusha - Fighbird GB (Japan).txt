The solar system is under threat by aliens that are being led by Dryas, with the help of a human mad scientist named Dr. Jango. The Space Police Force (SPF) is tasked with seeking out the Evil Energy that constitutes Dryas and destroying the mechabeasts that he deploys to attack the human race whether in Earth or in space.

The player at the start of the game gets to choose between two characters, Kenta, a special member of the SPF and grandson of Dr. Hiroshi Amano, the scientist that develops the mechs of the SPF; or the main character, Yuutarou Katori, the human identity of the space guardian known as Fighbird.
