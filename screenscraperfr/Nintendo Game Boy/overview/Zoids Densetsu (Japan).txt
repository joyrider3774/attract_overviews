Zoids Densetsu is a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up game set in the Zoids universe during Century Zero. The player has to choose a side: Helic Republic or Zenebas Empire and then plunge into battle inside a mech. The gameplay is a typical "shmup": your mech flies from left to right shooting enemies and confronting bosses at the end of stages. When your mech is defeated you mount another one with different looks and weapons.
