This version of FIFA '97 is different from its console counterparts. Besides the obvious graphic and sound limitations, this version does not feature any national leagues, instead offering 51 international teams to choose from plus the all-star THQ Tornados.

It still features the traditional game modes, Exhibition, Tournament, Playoff and League along with the standard set of rules and moves from the world of soccer (yellow and red cards, sliding tackles and lightning quick goalie reactions).
