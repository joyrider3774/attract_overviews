Universal Soldier is the licensed video game based on the 1992 movie starring Jean-Claude Van Damme.  You control Van Damme's character as he turns against his platoon and attempts to bring down the corrupt government organization that created him.

This game is a heavily modified port of Turrican II with different player and enemy sprites and cut scenes removed in order to tie it in to the Universal Soldier movie.
