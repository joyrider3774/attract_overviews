First portable title in the Ganbare Goemon series which tell the wacky adventures of the mystical ninja Goemon as he fights evil across feudal Japan and beyond. In this title an enemy of our hero has kidnapped Goemon's buddy Ebisumaru and now its up to Goemon to rescue him and defeat this new menace.

The game plays as an action RPG -lite played from a top-down perspective similar to classic Zelda games. Your objective involves traveling from town to town and get quests from assorted NPCs, which mostly involve retrieving items from enemy-filled stages. As reward you can get clues that aid you in your main quest as well as upgraded weapons and items that increase Goemon's abilities.
