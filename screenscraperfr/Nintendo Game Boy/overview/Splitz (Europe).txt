A game so simple yet so exciting that your nerves will start to tingle right from the very start. What can be simpler than arranging a few blocks to make a picture? Kid's stuff! Alas! the very block you want, is likely to shoot out the door or bounce off the wall. Wait a minute! Is that a bomb that has just come out of the chute? It may be a petrol can, harmless until you put a match to it and lose a life or pour water on, to neutralise it and earn bonus points.nnnnTwelve pictures to complete PLUS bonus levels. As time runs out and hazards increase, each level becomes a new and exciting challenge.
