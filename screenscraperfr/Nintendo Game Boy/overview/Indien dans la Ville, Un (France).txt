Little Indian in Big City, a.k.a. Little Indian, Big City, a.k.a. An Indian in the City is the English title of a French movie, Un indien dans la ville that I have never seen or heard of. It did receive an (apparently horrible) English dub in select areas, and it was even adapted into the more widely known (to Americans and other English-native speakers, at least) Jungle 2 Jungle. Yes, the Tim Allen movie with the jungle boy. But while Jungle 2 Jungle never received a video game adaptation, Little Indian in Big City did. This makes sense when you realize that it was adapted by the video game company Titus, who are also French.
