In the year 2593, on the planet alpha centauri 3, predators looking for a hunting ground plant alien eggs. The aliens soon hatch and wipe out the human population. However, when the predators move in for the hunt, they find they are vastly outnumbered and suffer the same fate. Only one of them survives. He theorizes that among the hatched aliens there was a queen that laid additional eggs, which would explain the huge number of aliens. The last survivor sets out to destroy the queen and regain the honor of his clan. The predator must traverse several side-scrolling levels on his way to the queen, while destroying aliens in all their forms - facehuggers hatched from eggs, chestburster aliens and fully grown warriors.
