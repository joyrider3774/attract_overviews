Crayon Shin-Chan is originally a manga by Yoshito Usui narrating the adventures of Shinosuke Nohara, a five-year-old boy who comes up with something special. This Game Boy adaptation is actually a compilation of mini-games. The young hero must thus challenge all the characters of the manga in various disciplines, between shots on goal and 1, 2, 3 sun.
