Hey renegade, now you live the ultimate off-road race adventure in a rough and tumble scramble to the finish line on your choice of over 22 authentic Jeep Jamboree courses.

You'll be in Jeep 4x4 heaven with these hard-driving features:
2-Player Game Boy Game Link: Why just compete against 20 strangers when you can enjoy a straight head-to-head race against one ruthless friend?!
Three types of race seasons: Short, intermediate or championship (practice Jeep Jamborees also available).
Courses that just keep getting tough: Just try and stay on the trail as you muscle your way through mud, hazardous road conditions and 20 road-hog competitors who'd just love to run you off the track.
