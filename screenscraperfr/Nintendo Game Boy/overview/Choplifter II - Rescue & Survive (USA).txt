SAVE THE HOSTAGES. SAVE THE WORLD.

Take off on a dangerous rescue mission in a world on the brink of all-out global war. Hostages must be saved from a sly and sinister enemy in order to avert total chaos. Only your skill can save us now.

You command the AH 90 Commanche attack helicopter, the ultimate fighting machine. Your arsenal includes: machine guns, flame throwers, missiles and invisibility. Superior technology must be used wisely against the omnipresent enemy. Antagonists attack with everything they've got: bullets, missiles, tanks, subterranean gun turrets and land mines. Hectic heli-heroics are required to save the hostages and yourself.

ChopLifter II features five stages, each with it's own threatening terrain. The game can be played by one or two players.
