Daisenryaku is a traditional military turn-based strategy game. The game uses "fake hexagons"; the hexagons are in fact square. There are two rivals in every scenario, "black" and "white" - and four sides are in game: US, USSR, FRG and Japan, each with specific units, based on realistic warfare, for example Mig-23, Su-24, T-80. Bradley, F-15, F-16.... Like in other Daisenryaku games, each side has to produce units such as infantry, several types of tanks, helicopters, etc. Different units have different strengths and weaknesses. The outcome of combat is determined by the attack strength which varies between different unit types. Game has 6 maps, can be played both against the console or against another human player.
