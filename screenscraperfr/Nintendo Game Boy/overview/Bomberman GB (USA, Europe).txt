Bomberman is searching the depths of the earth in hopes of finding the Legendary Treasure. In the Story Mode, guide him through 48 levels of puzzle-solving action, collecting power-up items and defeating monsters along the way. The Battle Mode is the old favorite, where one to four players battle it out on six different maps.
