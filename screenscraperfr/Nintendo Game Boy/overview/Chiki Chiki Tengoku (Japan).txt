Chiki Chiki Tengoku is a puzzle-game about Game Boy. The app proposes to align the symbols falling from above by three to make them disappear, pocket points and create stars instead. It is then the destruction of these stars which make appear the fairies. These last ones close the current stage if they can all fly away and that nothing remains on the screen. Strategy and organization are therefore required to correctly place all elements.nn
