Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a third-person platform/action game for Game Boy. It was developed by B.I.T.S.

The game is a side-scroller. The player moves from left to right, shooting enemies and jumping over obstacles in the platforming stages. There are also time-limited mini-games, such as re-arranging wires to form a connected path, as well as other types of stages. The stages are based on key scenes from the film.

At the beginning of the game, the player appears to be in the future, with Terminators attacking the player, and a Hunter Killer type robot dropping explosives around the player.
