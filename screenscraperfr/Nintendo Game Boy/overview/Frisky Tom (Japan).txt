Frisky Tom is a 1981 arcade game by Nichibutsu. The object of the game is to provide enough water for a shower by crawling along a network of plumbing pipes and picking up/replacing loose pieces. Various types of mice are the game's antagonists, trying to thwart Tom in different ways: knocking pipes loose to disrupt the water flow, jumping down to fall on him, or setting a bomb to blow up the entire plumbing arrangement. A version for the Atari 5200 was programmed in 1983, but was never published.[1] It was, however, released for the Nintendo Game Boy in 1995 and the PlayStation in 2002. A Bandai Electronics VFD hand held version of Frisky Tom was released in 1982.[2]

Mouskattack, another game featuring both mice and a pipe-laying theme, was published in 1982 by Sierra On-Line for the Atari 8-bit family and Apple II.
