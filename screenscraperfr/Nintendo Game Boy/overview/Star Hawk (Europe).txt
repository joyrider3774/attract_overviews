Can You Survive the Ceaseless Attack of Freakish Alien Mutants?nnnnAs a master mariner aboard the scout ship StarHawk, you have been sent to explore the Evil Empire of Axtar. You were preprared for almost anything - anything but the rampant mutants that ingest this raging realm of never-ending combat. Half organic, half technological, the freakish life forms of Axtar have only one instinct: to attack.nnnnHordes of alien beasties come at you from all sides as your ship is transported from world to world through five levels. You shudder at the sight of grotesque globule-emitting eyeballs, terrifying buzzsaw-like energy disks, implacable poison jetting phenocrysts, and huge end-level bosses.nnnnAs the battle rages on, you'll need nerves of steel and lightning quick reflexes to survive!
