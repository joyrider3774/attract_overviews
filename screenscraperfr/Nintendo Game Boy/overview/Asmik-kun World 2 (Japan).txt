Asmik-kun World 2 (?????? ???? 2 Asumikkun W?rudo 2) is a Game Boy video game by Asmik, copyrighted in 1991.Unlike its predecessor, Boomer's Adventure in ASMIK World (Teke! Teke! Asmik-kun World), this game was never released outside Japan. Like its predecessor, the game is an excellent example of the trap-em-up genre, which also includes games like Heiankyo Alien and Space Panic.

In the game, Asmik-kun has to build a "road" from the entrance to the exit in each level. An enemy has come to kidnap the children on a certain world and the "roads" are intended for the children to be rescued and escorted safely back home.[3]
