Puzzle No. 100 is the most challenging of all. Take your time as long as the batteries last.nnnnTake your best shot at 100 mind-boggling puzzles with a checker-like play. Each puzzle displays a unique marble pattern in which you must jump and eliminate all of the marbles on the board. There is one catch...the last marble must end up in the center of the board.nnnnA battery back-up saves two separate games and compares your score against the par set by Professor Lazlos.
