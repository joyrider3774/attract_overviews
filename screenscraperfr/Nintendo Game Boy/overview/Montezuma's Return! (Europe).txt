Max Montezuma is a soldier who also happens to be a descendant of a legendary Aztec emperor. One day Max's plane crashes on an uncharted, deserted island. Max discovers ancient ruins there and ventures to explore them, attempting to connect the mystery of the past with the events of the present.

Montezuma's Return is a sequel to Montezuma's Revenge, and also focuses on platforming gameplay which includes puzzle-solving, avoiding obstacles, and fighting enemies. Unlike its predecessor, it is a first-person 3D game. The player is able to see the protagonist's feet when moving the camera, to facilitate precise platform jumping.

Every level ends with a boss battle, and each boss must be defeated in a specific way. Max can punch and kick enemies, and also use environmental hazards to damage them; pushing enemies into water or luring them into traps will kill them. Some areas require Max to jump on moving platforms, climb ropes, swim, avoid falling into lava or deadly spikes, etc. Max can collect treasure on each level, bananas or watermelon slices to heal himself, and special items to unlock barriers.

The full version of Montezuma's Revenge is included on the CD.
