Bart Simpson here, on my way to the Springfield Arena to do battle with The Juggernauts, my all-time TV heroes.

It isn't going to be easy. There's nobody tougher than The Juggernauts (except maybe yours truly), but i'll be fighting 'em on my own turf: Krustyland Amusement Park, Moe's Tavern, and the Nuclear Power Plant, just to name a few.

No one knows this, but I've got a whole new set of cool manuevers AND a new technological edge - I can CHEAT!

I'm psyched. I'm ready to rock and roll. On to victory, Man!

Your pal,
Bart Simpson
