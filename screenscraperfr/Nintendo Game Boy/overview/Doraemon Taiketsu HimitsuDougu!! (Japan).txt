The first adventures of the robot cat from the future come in the form of an action game filled with challenges. Most of the time, it will be simulated shoot'em up in which the player has the obligation to reach a certain number of points to progress. If the realization turns out to be quite arbitrary, we still appreciate finding the universe of the manga of Hiroshi Fujimoto.
