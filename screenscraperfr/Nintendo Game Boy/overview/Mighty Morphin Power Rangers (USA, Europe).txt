In Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the player gets to play as any of the rangers (Jason, Trini, Billy, Kimberly, and Zack) through 7 levels. Except for the last few, all the other levels let the player pick whatever ranger wanted. Each has their own unique "super move". At the end, whoever the player choses to play as will automatically morph and at the end of each level the player gets to fight the boss.
