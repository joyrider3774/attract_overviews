Just Plane Fun!

Strap on your seat belt! Here's rollicking fun with Baloo and his cargo plane the Mini-Sea Duck. He's out delivering goods to all the people in the Cape. But Don Karnage and his goofy band of pirates are hot on Baloo's tail, trying to swipe the cargo!

It's high-flying adventure as Baloo dodges and shoots through the clouds and over skyscrapers. Alligators and natives rumble in the jungle. Cave dogs bash Baloo with bones. Submarines transform into helicopters. Baseballs as big as boulders give Baloo a rocky ride!

Baloo's got many trips to make so he's got to be a frisky flyer. Grab your goggles, and don't smack into a bubble. It could mean trouble!
