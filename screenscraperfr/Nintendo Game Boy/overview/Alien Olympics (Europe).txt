Alien olympics is a wacky combination of track & field games and retro-arcade games that you play as an alien. There are 8 unique alien characters that you can choose and compete against. Each alien has different strengths and weaknesses. For example, mr. Mune (a caterpillar-like alien) has many legs enabling him be very good at shooting events but also makes it difficult for him in racing events. You can either compete against a friend by sharing the keyboard or against the computer. There are a total of 15 different events to compete in and you have the choice of tackling a selected few, or going through the whole series. You also have the option of practicing first to get the hang of things.
