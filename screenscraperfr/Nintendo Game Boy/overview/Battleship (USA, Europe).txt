This is a shareware version of the classic board game Battleship by Milton Bradley.

Two players have a grid of boxes. You use your mouse to decide where your ships should go, and compete to try to find and sink your opponents ships.

There is a win record menu that tells how many time you won and lost or drew. Options include whether the game has a 10 x 10 or 15 x 15 board, and allow you to choose between a single shot or salvo shooting, and whether you can use Cluster bombs, Cruise missiles and Smart Bombs, and you can use Ship resources or Fleet resources. There are Beginner, Intermediate or Expert skill levels,  and you can decide who goes first, with the option of this being decided randomly.
