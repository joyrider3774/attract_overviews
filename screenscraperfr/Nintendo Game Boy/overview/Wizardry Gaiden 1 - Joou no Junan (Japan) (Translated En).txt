Wizardry Gaiden is a side story Wizardry game for Gameboy. It is an original, Japanese-only title, and is not a port of any computer versions. Its developer, ASCII, was also the developer that created the Wizardry 1 through 6 remakes for Famicom and Super Famicom, and as such Wizardry Gaiden retains much of the same look and feel of other console titles in the series. The gameplay system most closely resembles Wizardry V (released the following year for Super Famicom), with the addition of long-range weapons, enhanced spells, and auto-mapping.
