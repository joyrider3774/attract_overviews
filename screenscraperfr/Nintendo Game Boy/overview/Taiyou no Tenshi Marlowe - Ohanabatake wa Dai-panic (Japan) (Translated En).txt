Taiyou no Tenshi Marlowe: Ohanabatake wa Dai-Panic! (â€œSunshine Angel Marlowe: Panic in Bloomland!â€) or just â€œAngel Marloweâ€ is a weird game. Itâ€™s essentially a puzzle game thatâ€™s hard to categorize.
Despite being released only in Japan, the game is fully playable for non-Japanese speakers. The only thing you would be missing is the brief story, but there is a fan translation patch for anyone curious about the game.
The game consists of eight areas which you can beat in any order to unlock the final areas. Each area has a total of five stages that need to be beaten before you can clear the area and move onto the next one. Every area features a unique theme with cutesy graphics of enemies that are also surprisingly well animated for a GB game. The goal of each stage is to make all the flowers bloom while avoiding enemies and preventing them from destroying your work.
