The series follows the adventures of a five-year-old boy named Shinnosuke Nohara (nicknamed Shin-chan) and his family, neighbors, friends and relatives in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture, Japan. Shinnosuke's family was initially composed of four members, including Shinnosuke, Misae Nohara (the mother), Hiroshi Nohara (the father) and Shiro (the dog). Family members reach five when the last one arrives, Shinnosuke's little sister, Himawari Nohara. Also on the family side, his angry and often authoritarian grandfather Yoshiji is the opposite of his other grandfather, Ginnosuké, nicknamed "Ginny", who is joking and also perverse. Shinnosuke hangs out most of the time with four of his friends: Nene, Kazama, Masao and Bo. He goes to nursery school where he attends teachers such as Mademoiselle Yoshinaga and Mademoiselle Matsuzaka as well as the principal of the school, Mr. Takakura, whom he and his friends nickname "The godfather" because of his dress and his mafia appearance. Shin-chan is secretly in love with his former teacher, Nanako Ōhara, and also a fan of two superheroes he particularly appreciates, Action Kamen and Cuntom Robo.
