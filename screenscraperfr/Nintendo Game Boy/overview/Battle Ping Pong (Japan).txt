In Battle Ping Pong the player can battle against ten AI enemies in a table tennis game. Those opponents represent ten countries which are humorously depicted, e.g. the USA athlete wears a cowboy hat. The goal of a single-player game is to beat all of them. Regarding gameplay, the player only has to hit the ball with the correct timing and can perform a few basic moves. The game is played in a first-person perspective: only the table tennis racket is visible.
