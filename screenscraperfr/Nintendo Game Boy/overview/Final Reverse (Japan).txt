This shoot'em up is quite unique. It is indeed not a question, here, of crossing levels by destroying enemy vessels, but of competing with a rival in a place that boils down to a closed arena. In the end, Final Reverse comes down to a mix between Arkanoid and Snke to the extent that the lines of displacement are sometimes imposed. A title playable for two, certainly particular, but not uninteresting.
