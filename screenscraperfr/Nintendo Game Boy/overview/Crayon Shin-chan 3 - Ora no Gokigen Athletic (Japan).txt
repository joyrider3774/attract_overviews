Third episode of Shinosuke's adventures on the Game Boy, the recipe is not this time the same since the boy must this time roam in his neighborhood, and meet the challenges imposed by other characters in the manga. The mini games, in quite a large number, are very well done and quite fun. A nice surprise, especially for those who love the series, and are sensitive to his humor.
