They never talked about being captured by aliens back in Astronaut School... So what's an astronaut supposed to do? Why, escape, of course, which is exactly what Humprey the astronaut sets out to do. He must make his way through the alien ship (over 250 rooms, all different, all dangerous) to reach an escape pod and return to Earth. Aliens, droids and tricky traps are waiting for him. He's counting on YOUR help!
