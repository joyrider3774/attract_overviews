The basic gameplay is pretty straightforward. You're 
the cute little fellow with the B on his suit. You find 
yourself at the top of some structure with various 
creatures climbing to the top. You'll notice there's a 
crosshair on the screen. Pushing the A button fires a 
beam wherever that crosshair is aimed at. Move it with 
the directional pad. Pushing the B button makes your 
character jump, and pushing Start accesses your item 
inventory.

Your goal, is to cut out parts of the wall with 
your beam, causing them to fall on the enemies below. 
You should be careful not to cut out too big of a 
piece; otherwise you'll find yourself not having any 
usable pieces of the wall later on in the level. It can 
be very easy to do so without noticing.

If an enemy reaches the top of the building, touching 
it will cause you to lose a turn. It'll either start to 
crawl towards one side of the screen, or keep flying 
into the air. It's possible to jump past it and avoid 
it, however, when it leaves the screen, your enemy 
count won't go down.
