This game on Gameboy is largely based on the movie "A New Hope" from the Star Wars Saga, released in 1977. It combines many game styles, but mainly an horizontal scrolling platformer. The game begins on Tatooine, where you play as Luke Skywalker. You will then have the opportunity to control Princess Leia and Han Solo.
