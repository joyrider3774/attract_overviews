IT'S TIME FOR A LITTLE HARDWOOD HYSTERIA

Your coach leads the team in a pre-game moment of silence. The only sound heard from the locker room is the methodical dripping of a leaky shower head. Then, with intensity in his eyes, coach looks up and growls "Time to crash the boards!" The screams of 40,000 strong reverberate through the packed arena as you blast out of the tunnel and into the blinding camera light of the national media. Welcome to the only pro-style, five on five game ever to hit the hardwood!

In this conquest to be the best, you'll need to have more talent in your little fingers than the competition as you try to slam, pass, steal, free throw, jump shoot and drive the lane against eight different teams. Each with players of varying strength and weakness. The cameras will even zoom in when you go airborne for the rim rockin' slams! But you don't become a foul-happy hatchet man or the refs will have you turning the ball over more than a flapjack cook at a Pancake Emporium. Pump up the high-tech hi tops, you're jammin' with the big boys now!
