Youâ€™re an Indian boy named Mowgli, and you were raised by a pack of wolves. No parents. No school. No problems. Great life, huh? Except thereâ€™s a rumor that Shere Khan the man-eating tiger is coming after you. So now youâ€™ve got to sneak, swing and swoop your way through the jungle, catch the tiger by the tail and reach the safety of the man-village.

To do this, you have to get the hang of incredibly tricky vines, neutralize venom balls, dodge coconut-throwing monkeys and fire off bananas at any scorpion, vampire bat, or crazy ape that gets in your way. So eat your potassium. It's a jungle out there!
