Yoshi's Cookie is a fast-paced puzzle game. The player moves randomly placed cookies into rows and columns of cookies with similar patterns. When a row or column of the same cookies is successfully assembled, the line will disappear, and the player can begin to work on a new row or column. The "Yoshi" cookie is very special in both the 1-player and the 2-player game. Since this cookie is the key to both games, it should be used wisely.
