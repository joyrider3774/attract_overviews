In Same Game, the player must clear the entire playfield by selecting at least two adjacent colored cells.

Depending on the difficulty setting, the playfield and the number of colors differ (from 5x5 with 3 colors to 20x15 with 4 colors). Once a set is selected, it is removed and the remaining cells are "consolidated" (cells above fall down, cells moving to the left if there is a horizontal space). This also means that possible set get destroyed when the cells are moving.

As soon as the player removes all cells, the game completes. If even only one cell remains, the game is lost.
