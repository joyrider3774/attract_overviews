The Nekketsu gang hits the sands for a grand tournament of beach volleyball. As usual the game mechanics have been somewhat modified from other volleyball games in order to include the classic gameplay elements from the Nekketsu series that involve adding beat 'em up elements to each sport. You can perform special throws and bomb shots as well as collect special power-ups that increase your team's abilities.

The game includes a standard 1P two-on-two tournament mode as well as a Vs mode for link-up multiplayer.
