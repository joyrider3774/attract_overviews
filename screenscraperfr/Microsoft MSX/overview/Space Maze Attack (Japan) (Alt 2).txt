Space Maze Attack is a top-down shooter in which the player navigates a white spaceship in search of treasure through claustrophobic mazes that are infested with hostile aliens. The spacecraft is equipped with a simple peashooter and has limited energy. When the energy runs out, the spaceship explodes. Upon finding a treasure, the unused energy is converted to points and a new level starts. There is also a 2-player mode where two people can take turns in order to find out who can amass the highest score.
