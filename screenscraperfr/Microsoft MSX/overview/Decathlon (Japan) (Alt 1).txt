Decathlon is a 1-2 player sports game combining ten athletics track and field events.
The game can be played as single events or in a full 10 event competition against the computer or/and a human opponent.

The competing events in the game are the normal: 100m sprint race, 400m dash, 1500m run,
110m hurdles, long jump, high jump, pole vault, shot put, discus throw and javelin throw.

Players can select their country (and the opponents) from eight predefined: UK, France, Germany, Austria, USA, Canada, Japan, Taiwan.
The competitors names are not changeable, e.g. 'Tommy' will always compete for the UK.

Only two players (human or computer) compete against each other in every event, so even if in the 1500m run four characters are running on the track; the two extras are just filling out the field, creating a tripping hazard for the two actual competitors.

Each character has a stamina/power that affects his performance, so the player has to keep within the avatars limits, or he gets too tired.

After a single race, the player gets the option of trying again, or ending the event.

In a full decathlon, a points table is filled in as the events progress.
