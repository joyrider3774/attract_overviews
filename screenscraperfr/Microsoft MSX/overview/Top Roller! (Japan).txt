You are in control of a roller skater that takes part in a roller skating race against the clock for 1 or 2 players. You have to reach the finish line and must try to bump opposing roller skaters of the track, they certainly try to bump you off! You also have to avoid several obstacles, water passages, traffic and bombing helicopters.
