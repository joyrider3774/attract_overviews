Computer Othello is an othello/reversi arcade game by Nintendo. It was the first video game developed by Nintendo Research & Development. As the name implies, it is a computerized version of othello. However, because the game is in monochrome with green sprites on a black background, noughts and crosses are placed instead of the traditional pieces. The goal is to trap your opponent's pieces between yours, turning them into your pieces. When there are no free spaces left, whoever has the most pieces wins.
