AKA: Moai No HihÅ 
AKA: Secret Treasure of Moai

In The Secret Treasure Of Moai your goal is to reach the level exit at the top by climbing and destroying the rock structures before you run out of time or got caught by enemies.

The rocks can be destroyed with the hammer that you carry. When destroying rock formations you might find special items and you should collect these or otherwise you might end up being unable to reach the level exit. You also won't reach the end of the level if you destroy the wrong rock structures or destroy them in the wrong order. As you progress in the game the puzzles to reach the exit become more challenging.

The game contains bonus stages in which you have to collect as much diamonds as you can within the time limit. (Moby Games)
