Yellow Submarine is a variant of the submarine game, one of the oldest versions of which is the Atari 2600 game Air-Sea Battle(1977). The premise is that the player, as captain on a submarine, must shoot at mine-releasing surface ships and sub-hunting planes, all the while avoiding enemy submarines and their torpedoes. The key to playing the game correctly is to properly time the missiles/torpedoes, as well as taking their trajectory into account.
