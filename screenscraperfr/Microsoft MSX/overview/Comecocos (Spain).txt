Comecocos can be defined, basically, as Pac-Man with new mazes. In this way, the game retains intact the original concept of the Namco's classic game, with the only addition of new mazes of crescent shapes.

The game doesn't let you modify any parameters - in fact the main (and only) menu only have two options: play and exit. At least the game saves the ten best scores in a high score table.
