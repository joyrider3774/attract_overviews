Another arcade classic finds a new form in 3D! And this time it's Lode Runner...

Lode Runner 2 is the sequel to the remake of Doug Smith's timeless classic. The game features 5 unique worlds where in each level you will try to collect all the gold without dying. Run, dig, climb, scale, fall, drob bombs and collect stuff! 

Like in Jazz Jackrabbit 2, this sequel has also added a companion (Jane) to its main character (Jake Peril). They are identical in their capabilities --no special moves. Choose one of them and get into Lode Runner's new dimension!
