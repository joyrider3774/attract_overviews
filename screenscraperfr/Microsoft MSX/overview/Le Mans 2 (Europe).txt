An early first-person-view racing game, Le Mans purports to take you to the famous French race track, but not to a real-time recreation of the famous 24 hours race ? instead, it's the "vingt-quatre minutes du Mans". The game uses the usual "striped grass" effect to simulate speed. Push up on the joystick to accelerate, but don't drive too fast in the curves, or you will drive off the road and the car will flip over.
