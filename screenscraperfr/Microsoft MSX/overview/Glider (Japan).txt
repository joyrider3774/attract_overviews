Glider puts the player in control of a paper airplane. The game consists of fifteen rooms and the player's task is to fly the plane through all of them. Each room is one screen in size and are viewed from the side. Controls are simple with only two keys used to move the glider: backward and forward. Since the airplane naturally seeks the floor it is necessary to use the wind coming from floor vents to gain height. Obstacles that have to be avoided include tables, candles and electrical outlets. Good items to touch are clocks which give points and sheets of paper which give extra gliders. If touching any obstacles the glider is lost. The number of gliders available is by default four but can be set from one to six.
