Enix kickstarted the whole mystery Japanese adventure game craze of the 80s with Portopia Satsujin Renzoku Jiken, which was followed up by two sequels, all three of which were helmed by star developer Yuji Horii. Lesser known is this game, Animal Land Satsujin Jiken (“Animal Land Murder Case”), despite following the same mold…except all of the characters are anthropomorphic animals. The story puts you in the shoes of a rookie canine shamus named Oidon, as he investigates the murder of Gonkichi, a fox and owner of a jewelry store. The story gets even darker when the case interweaves with the suicide a panda named Linlin.
