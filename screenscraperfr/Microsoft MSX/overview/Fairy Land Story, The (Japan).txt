The Fairyland Story puts the player in control of Ptolemy the witch, who must make her way through 101 single-screen rounds and defeat the evil purple dragon Dracolisk to retrieve the holy diamond and return peace to the land. Ptolemy's main weapon is her magic attack, which turns enemies into cakes for a short while, then the enemies can be either destroyed by further magic attacks or by being dropped off a platform, possibly squashing other enemies below.
