In Edge the player controls a cube in a geometric landscape consisting of platforms and moving shapes viewed from an isometric perspective. Throughout the world are prisms that the player has to pick up, although they are optional to finish a level. Each level is full of traps where the player can fall if he does not manage to roll his cube from a platform to another in the right time. After a level has been completed the player gets a rating based on how many times he has failed, the number of prisms he has picked up and how long it has taken.
