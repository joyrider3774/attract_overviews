They are among us, who? Invaders, aliens or aliens, in short, little green guys! Obviously to make a game they must be bad and want to take possession of our beautiful planet, otherwise it's not funny. As you have guessed, freedom lies on your shoulders and depends on your accuracy in shooting and acrobatics. nnUs vs. Them is an aerial shoot game with a rather classic and unpretentious realization where your ship is more or less inlaid in a background animated by videos. To make the interludes more dynamic, scenes with real actors punctuate the story in a spirit close to the TV series of the 80s. The game will appeal to lovers of science fiction, shoot and low budget TV series. Others will more readily turn to titles like M.A.C.H. 3.
