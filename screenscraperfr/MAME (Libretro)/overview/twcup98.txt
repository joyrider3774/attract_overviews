YuGiOhFan2012 rates this game: 2/5Tecmo World Cup '98 is the 1998 iteration of the famous Tecmo World Cup series of games, containing 16 national soccer teams (including Brazil, Japan, France, and the USA).
Unlike the real World Cup, which features a group stage and playoff tournament, the player, upon selecting his/her favorite team, must defeat all 15 other teams to win the Tecmo World Cup. 
There are 90 seconds (plus stoppage time, known as "LOSSTIME" in-game) in a one-player game, and 120 seconds (plus LOSSTIME) in a two-player game. If a match ends in a draw, the game continues with a 30-second sudden-death period (called VGOAL), and a sudden-death penalty shootout.
The winner of a two-player match continues his/her quest for the Tecmo World Cup.
Each team has its own special power-ups which can be activated by pressing certain button combinations. During the course of the game, if the player wins enough matches, he/she can add additional power-ups to his/her team.
