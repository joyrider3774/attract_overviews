Off Road Challenge is an off-road truck racing game. The player races against other off-road vehicles across various landscapes, while collecting nitros and gold along the way. Gold picked up on the course or earned from racing can be used to upgrade the vehicle. Once the player has completed the circuit, they move up to the next difficulty level and go through it again, keeping the upgraded truck.
