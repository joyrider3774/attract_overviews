My Hero is a very basic beat-'em-up game, where the objective is to travel to the right, punching and kicking enemies while trying not to be hit too many times yourself. Eventually you will come to a clearing and have to fight a boss - defeating him will briefly reunite you with your girlfriend, before she is kidnapped again. The game loops indefinitely, and ends when the player runs out of lives.
