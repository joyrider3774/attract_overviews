Is an arcade game developed by Falcon, released in 1981 and is similar to Nintendo's Donkey Kong. Although commonly believed to be a bootleg version, the game was officially licensed for operation only in Japan when Nintendo couldn't keep up with demand at home (even though Donkey Kong was still released there),[1] and is based on different hardware. The game retains all of the gameplay elements of Donkey Kong, but has all of the graphics redrawn and re-colorized. It is also known with four names: Congorilla, Big Kong, Donkey King, and Monkey Donkey.
