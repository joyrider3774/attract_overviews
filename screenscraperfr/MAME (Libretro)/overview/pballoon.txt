Guide a balloon across a variety of frontiers dropping bombs on your enemies. Dodge arrows shot from a covered wagon, boomerangs thrown by natives, coconuts hurled by gorillas, geyser sprays, cannonballs and deadly birds. Finally, navigate the balloon over mountains and make a precise landing at Fort Freedom.
