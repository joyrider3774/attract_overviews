Although the game is in 2D, it uses camera angles positioned behind the characters to create a 3D-like experience. The game is controlled with a joysick and 3 buttons; a deluxe edition of the game features motion sensors that allow the player to move his or her body to control the character in the game. The object of the game is to defeat six opponents. The playable characters are Goku, Gohan, Piccolo, Vegeta, and Future Trunks. The final boss is an original character named Ozotto.
