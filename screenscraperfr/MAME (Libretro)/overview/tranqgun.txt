Tranquilizer Gun is a multi-directional shooter arcade game. The player must use a four-directional joystick to direct a yellow hunter around a maze with a single button to make him fire shots (from that eponymous "tranquilizer gun") at four different types of wild animals (snakes, elephants, gorillas and lions) to knock them out. Once you have fired a shot at an animal to knock him out, the number 30 will appear below him and start counting down - and this means that you will have thirty seconds to bring the animal out of any of the maze's six exits as his truck drives around and he puts him inside, causing the number below that type of animal's head upon the side to go up by one. Snakes are worth 200 points, gorillas 300, lions 400, and elephants 500; you will also receive a 10% bonus at the end of a round if you did not waste any of your shots.
