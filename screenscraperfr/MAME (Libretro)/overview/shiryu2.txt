Strider Hiryu 2 is a direct sequel to the superb 1989 original, the player once again takes on the role of Strider Hiryu; a ninja who wields a deadly plasma-ejecting cypher called the 'Falchion'. Players start the game by selecting one of three difficult missions, with a fourth becoming available once the initial three are completed. Completing the fourth mission will unlock the final 'boss' mission, in which the player must battle a number of bosses which includes the rogue 'Strider Hien' from the first Strider game. Once all missions are completed, the character of Strider Hien - who wields two ranged cyphers - is unlocked.
