Colossus is without a doubt the most comprehensive chess program available for home computers and was written using the latest techniques by a computer chess programmer with eight years of experience. Colossus also offers the choice between displaying the usual two-dimensional table or the new three-dimensional table as in reality, which, linked to the joystick control, makes it easy to use.
