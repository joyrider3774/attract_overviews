A bunch of aliens want to colonise a planet called Genus II. However, its inhabitants aren't very welcoming, and have set them a tough test, in the form of lots of questions. Like the board game, you have to collect six wedges before the final test, but instead of rolling a die, you can choose any of dozens of planets, each with its own scenery and category.
