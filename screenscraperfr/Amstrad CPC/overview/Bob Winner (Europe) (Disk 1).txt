Bob Winner is searching for a lost civilisation somewhere in the desert, and has to gain three keys to access it by beating a boss in Paris, London, and New York respectively. The first two bosses are boxers, the last one is a gun-toting cowboy. The items necessary to beat the bosses are found on the preceding screens.

So far the rather weak story for this typical French side-view flip-screen action adventure that focuses not so much on combat but on avoiding rather unmotivated rolling barrels and flying insects and is remarkable mainly because of its at the time outstanding graphics.
