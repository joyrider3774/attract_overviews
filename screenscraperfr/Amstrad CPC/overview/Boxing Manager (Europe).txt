Boxsport Manager is a managerial simulation where the player manages a boxing promoton company. At the start of the game the player creates his own boxer who is represented by seven attributes, e.g. strength or stamina, and 20 talents which are divided into three categories (strength, technique and defense). Every boxer gains experience points when fighting which can be used to improve these attributes and talents. On the athletic side the player also sets the training and detailed fighting tactics for different situations.

Money is earned by arranging events with up to five fights. There the player chooses the stadium and the boxers. Then he sets the ticket prizes, the advertising and negotiates to sell the TV rights. When the company grows he can hire more boxers and other employees. There are three options how to watch the individual matches: skip it altogether, only see the round results or watching it in a 3D presentation. With the last two options the player has the opportunity to slightly change the tactics by giving the boxer a single order after every round.
