Froggy is a Frogger variant. The object is to get your frog across a road with traffic, then over a river of turtles and logs to one of five safety spots. In later levels, there is more traffic, snakes on the river bank and alligators in the river and, sometimes, in a safety spot. Once all five safety spots are filled, the game starts you at the next, harder level. There are four levels in total. After you beat the fourth level, you just replay that level until you run out of lives.
