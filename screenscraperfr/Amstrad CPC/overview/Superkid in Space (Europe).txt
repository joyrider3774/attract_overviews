The genetically modified youth Superkid is mankind's only hope as various alien species encroach on our resources. As Superkid, the player must explore five alien planets in turn, finding four pieces of the detonator required to destroy each. He will require the pills that are hidden throughout to maintain his superhuman strength. Additionally, he is armed with a rope which can be used to hook upwards onto ceiling sections of each level. Before the main platforming action starts the player must land the ship safely onto a smooth piece of land, with a points bonus for getting it right and an energy penalty for getting it wrong.
