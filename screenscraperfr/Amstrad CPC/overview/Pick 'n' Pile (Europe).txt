Pick balls of the same colour and pile them on top of each other to blow them up! You have to remove all of the balls on each level within the time limit. Extra points can be gained by using the multipliers and points blocks, and you get enough in one go, you'll get a gem, and once you've built up a bit of a collection, you'll get a huge bonus. Watch out for the monsters, though, who will eat away at your time limit if they touch the floor!
