Your quest is to retrieve the Amulet of Yendor which lies deep within the Dungeons of Doom. The dungeons are generated randomly, so you'll never play the same game twice. You roam around the levels of the dungeon, collecting gold pieces, potions, magic scrolls and other items, and fighting monsters, which increases your strength and experience so that you are better prepared for the lower levels.
