In this simulation you can race ten international circuits, including traditional favourites such as Monza, Monaco and Silverstone plus no-longer-used circuits like Zandvoort and the Osterreichring. This can be done in wet or dry, and with manual or automatic gears. Expect to have to drive realistically in terms of braking points and acceleration levels to set a quality lap.

The Spectrum version includes a 'steering wheel' control option, using a small disc along the top of the keyboard, using the keys for progressive steering intensity.
