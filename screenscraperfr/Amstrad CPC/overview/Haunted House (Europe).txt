Part of Incentive's Double Gold series, this text adventure sees you taking on the role of a poor old gentleman of the road who just wants a cosy room for the night. Rifling through bins isn't a career move that brings big rewards, so you end up looking for somewhere dark and quiet. You find a stunning building and no one seems to be in! What luck! The adventure begins with you stuck inside the house with only your trusty torch as a guide within the gloom.
