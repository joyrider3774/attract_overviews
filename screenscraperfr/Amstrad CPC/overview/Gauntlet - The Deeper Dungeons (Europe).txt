An early Defender clone for the CPC. In this version, you defend canisters littered along the landscape from a hostile alien race called the Reeg forces. When a Reeg ship lifts a canister and reaches the top of the screen, the cargo changes into a mutant hellbent on destroying you! Fail to kill all the baddies quickly enough and another group of ships appears, moving much more quickly, their cannons firing at you.
