A quiet holiday camp at Crystal Lake is disturbed when one of the campers, Jason, is drowned. His mother, distraught with grief, blames the other campers who did nothing to help him. She vows revenge and murders all the holiday makers except one girl who kills her. The survivor floats into the middle of the lake where Jason rises from the water, to take his revenge.

Jason is still wreaking havoc throughout Crystal Lake when you arrive for a holiday. Your task is to find a safe sanctuary where Jason cannot go and then persuade your friends to gather there.

You have to identify Jason! He is a normal player moving around the game until he attacks or is attacked. You are warned about each attack and have a chance to find him, but Jason waits for no man.
