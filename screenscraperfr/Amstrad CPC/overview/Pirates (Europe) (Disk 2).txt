In Pirates the player has been tasked by the queen to defend a castle against an attack by the pirate Sir Edwin Denner. This is done by using a cannon located at the top of a tower to sink the pirate's ship. The game is a bit similar to an artillery game but here the player's input is limited to entering the number of bags of powder (from 1 to 10) that should be loaded and then watch the flight of the cannon ball. To be able to sink the ship it is necessary to first destroy its three sails in order, starting with the top one. After each shot Sir Edwin makes one shot on the tower which will collapse after taking six hits. The player will then end up walking the plank. If the player manages to sink the ship a medal will be awarded.
