Several magazines completely disliked this collection of six Pong-style bat-and-ball games (which, incidentally, was released as Video Classics), but I didn't think it was that bad. The six games are tennis, football, squash, solo squash, 4-bat blip, and Asterbliperoids, and they're all pretty much the same, with some minor differences.
