La AbadÃ­a del Crimen was originally conceived as a version of Umberto Eco's book The Name of the Rose.

This game is a videoadventure with 3D isometric graphics, where a Franciscan friar, William of Occam (William of Baskerville in the book) and his young novice Adso have to discover the perpetrator of a series of murders in a medieval Italian abbey.
