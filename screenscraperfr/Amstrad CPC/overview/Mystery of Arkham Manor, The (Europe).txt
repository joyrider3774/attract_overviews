The Mystery of Arkham Manor is a detective adventure horror game inspired by H. P. Lovecraft's fictionalized world of Arkham.

The player will play as the London Chronicle?s freelance reporter, and he will start the game moments after he arrives by train at the local train station. He has to be both reporter and detective to decipher what has been happening in the villag. But the only clue he has in his possession is Colonel Lemin?s intriguing letter. 

During the gameplay there are several characters to be interviewed, objects to be picked up, photographs to be taken, stories to be reported, and questions to be made to the newspaper.
