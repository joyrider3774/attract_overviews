The Island is a traditional text adventure where you as the protagonist have survived a plane crash into the ocean and wound up on a nearby island. The island is the tip of a once mighty volcano, surrounded by a chain of further volcanoes. The objective is to escape to civilisation alive.
It is mostly known for its lengthy maze sections and the obligatory treasure hunt which did little to set it apart from its contemporaries.
