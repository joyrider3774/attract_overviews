History recalls the epic 'Highway Encounter.' The attempted domination of Earth by the dreaded Alien aggressor was foiled by the power of the Vortons.

Your mission is to strike at the industrial heart of the Alien Empire, before they remass with even greater force. As controller of the Vorton you must manoeuvre the Terratron to the end of the 'Alien Highway.'  It is vital the Terratron be energized en route by contact with seven regeneration stations.
Only by achieving this can you proceed through the barrier guarding the Industrial Complex.

There, the Terratron will reveal it's awesome power.
