Brainstorm is a puzzle game for one to four players. The rules are simple: when starting a new game it randomly fills a 8x8 grid with positive and negative numbers. One vertical or horizontal line is marked with a red frame. Now the first player chooses one number within the frame which increases or decreases his point score accordingly to the number. The the frame turns 90Â° and marks another line. The the next player in line chooses a number and so one. When all numbers are taken the player with the highest score wins. The second player can be simulated by an AI.
