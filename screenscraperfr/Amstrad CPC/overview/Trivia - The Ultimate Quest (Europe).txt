If your brain is filled with knowledge of TV, films, geography, history, literature, science and sport, then you might like this trivia quiz game. There is only one aim in this 'ultimate quest', and that is to accumulate as many points as possible. Each question you are given has three possible answers, and you must choose correctly before the time limit. If your choice is correct, you get a token, and if you collect 21 tokens, you score bonus points and start collecting tokens again. However, the clock becomes faster as you get more tokens, and the game is over if you answer three questions wrongly.
