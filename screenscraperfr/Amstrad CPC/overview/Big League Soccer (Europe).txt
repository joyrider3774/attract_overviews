Almost as hard as United but much clearer graphics and simpler format. You have a choice of colours and any of 88 teams, and the game tells you the strength of the opposition, which is very useful.nnnnWith 42 matches per season, the game is demanding, especially as you have to pick your side from scratch before each match (rather than make changes from the previous match).
