If your brain is full of useless facts and you feel like learning some more, then try this game. Up to four players can test their knowledge of music, sport, showbiz and trivia. Each round consists of answering five questions where you score points, followed by the 'money maze' where you can score both points and money (allowing you to continue if you get a question wrong).
