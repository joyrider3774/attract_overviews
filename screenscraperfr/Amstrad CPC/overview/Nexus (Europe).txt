Nexus is a simple FPP labyrinth game. The player takes on the role of a rebel against authority and as a punishment ends up on the lowest level of the dungeon. The aim of the player is to find five hearts and the flap to the next level maze. Each movement takes some energy. The decrease of energy to zero means death. The energy is supplemented by collecting hearts. The gameplay screen shows the current chamber and the door to the next areas, level number, remaining lives and energy.
