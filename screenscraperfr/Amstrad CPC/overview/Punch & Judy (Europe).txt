Punch's stall has been dismantled and the pieces are scattered all over the seaside resort of Bridlington, with all its tacky caf√©s, shops and amusement arcades. You've got to find all the pieces and then find the cast who are also wandering the streets, before the tide comes in. Don't run into Mr. Policeman, though, or you'll be arrested!
