Metropolis is the city of the future, founded in 5067. You are a security agent for the software company IC&D and your adventure is about to begin. Solve ten different crimes and voyage the city through a series of "Zoomtubes". Just don't give out your M.U.M. code to ANYONE!

The game is largely conversation-driven, with a 20,000 word spoken vocabulary and advanced artificial intelligence.
