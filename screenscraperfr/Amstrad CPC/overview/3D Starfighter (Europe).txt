Your Quest... to destroy the enemy Battlestar that threatens all other known life forms!! Blinky, your onboard computer, will guide you through the quest with messages on the screen. Each alien has a shield of a certain strength which you must break through to kill it. But the more often you fire, the weaker your laser bolts get... so you must target your shots carefully without exhausting your laser reserves. If an alien comes close, use your shield to protect your ship... they will bounce off, sustaining damage.
