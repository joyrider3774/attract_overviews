You are Stock Car Champion, Rick Radial who has the best sponsorships and now the pick of the best cars. You have a choice from a Ferrari, Lamborghini, Lotus  or Porsche to race in now. To become champion again you have to drive against three other drivers to qualify within a time limit over five laps on six different courses. Once you qualify you move onto the next track. When all six courses are completed you start on Course One but with the difficulty harder. If you hit the side of the track or another driver this causes you to spin and stop.

 Super Stock Car is a one or two player racing game viewed from above showing a small part of the track. The keyboard or joystick is used to control the car. Each player takes it in turn to get as far in the game as possible before the next player has a go.
