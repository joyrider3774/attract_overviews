3D Grand Prix is a 1st person perspective driving game where you must race against various other drivers over five laps to win the race on a randomly generated track. You start on the grid and when the lights turn green you accelerate away changing up the six gears your car has. As you accelerate you need to keep an eye on your rev counter, have it too high and your engine will blow and it is race over. As you approach a bend you are told the recommended speed to take the bend and you are updated regularly the weather with updates. As you finish a lap the road surface becomes checkered indicating you can stop your car to use the pits.
