The kingdom of Torot has been cursed and only Sir Galaheart can return it to normality again by seeking the sacred Firestone, which is in the hands of the Evil Queen. Torot covers a large area, and to get anywhere, you're going to have to collect the objects which are scattered around and trade them with other folk. You'll also have to make a map and note some teleport codes!
