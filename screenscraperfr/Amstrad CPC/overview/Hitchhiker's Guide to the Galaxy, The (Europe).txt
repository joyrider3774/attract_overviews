You are Arthur Dent, an Englishman with a bad hangover wearing a dressing gown containing a much needed buffered analgesic and some fluff. Your house has just been destroyed, followed shortly thereafter by your planet Earth (mostly harmless). You ve been rescued by your friend Ford Prefect, whos not actually an out-of-work actor. He has given you a book , a towel, and is now telling you to put a fish in your ear. It must be a Thursday; youve never quite gotten the hang of Thursdays.
