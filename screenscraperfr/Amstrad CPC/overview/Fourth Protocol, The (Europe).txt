The Soviet Union has planted a nuclear device somewhere in the United Kingdom and is intending to detonate it before the General Election to bring about a totalitarian British state. You are John Preston, an investigator at MI5, and you have to stop the Russians' dastardly plans. This game is based on Frederick Forsyth's novel of the same name and is in three parts.
