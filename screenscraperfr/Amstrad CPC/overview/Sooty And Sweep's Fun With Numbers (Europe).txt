Six short mathematical tests aimed at children up to 7 years of age come together in this package. Sooty the silent magical bear is one of the UKs most enduring childrens characters, and his friends Sweep the squeaking dog and Soo the talking bear join him here. The games can be played with little or no computer knowledge, and feature full graphics.

In Magic Numbers the player must count how many wands Sooty has on the screen. Sweeps Bones involves moving bones from a pile on the right (Sweeps stash) to the left (the ones he will enjoy today). Soos Hats is an addition test. In Bigger/Smaller you are presented with 2 numbers, and asked to select the biggest or smallest, which Sooty will magic away with his wand. Order Order presents a line of numbers, some of which are filled in, and challenges the player to select the others (which are randomly arranged elsewhere on the screen) and place them in the correct positions. Soo?s Race brings these skills together ? you are asked a succession of questions, and answering them correctly will see Sooty?s car move along a track, and hopefully win its race against Sweep.
