Wiping, later rereleased as Rug Rats, is Dig Dug-style arcade game that was released by Nichibutsu in 1982; it utilises two Zilog Z80 microprocessors (running up at 3.072 MHz) and a custom sound chip running at the same speed. The player must use a 4-way joystick to take control of a vacuum cleaner (which bears a striking resemblance to Numatic International's then-new "Henry") with a single button to make it spray soapbubbles at germs (of which there are three different types, "Baddons", "Bilbolas" and "Bigimbas"), and roll over them while they're stunned to suck them up - and it can also pass over rugs to make them roll up and squash any germs standing on them, but it can also be a victim of this.
