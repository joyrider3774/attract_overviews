Devil Fish is a maze arcade game released by Artic Electronics in 1982. It was not ported to any home systems.
The player uses a four-position joystick to maneuver a dog through a maze and avoid several wandering squid. The maze is filled with gates of varying sizes that slow the player's movement while passing through them. The player must pick up fish as they appear, then press a button to drop them and lure the squid toward the gates. Tunnels allow the player to move from the left side to the right and vice versa; some tunnels are permanently open, while others have barriers that periodically open and close.
