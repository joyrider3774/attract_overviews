This game is also known as "Painted Lady".

Splash! was developed by a freelance group called OMK from Barcelona. OMK itself were three members: a programmer and two graphic artists. The music and sound was always made at Gaelco. Nowadays, OMK has disappeared, but one of the graphic artists is still working at Gaelco. Splash! was a big success.
