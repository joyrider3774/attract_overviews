The Ultimate 11 is the fourth game in the Super Sidekicks series. Regional tournaments are replaced with the SNK Football Championship, which is an elimination tournament in which the player's team can select any team from any region to play against. The final team played against in this tournament is the SNK Superstars, which consists of characters from SNK's fighting games. A new addition is the charge bar. It's charged depending on how long a team has the ball, and when full, it can be used when near a goal to make a near-unblockable shot. The game features 80 national teams split into 8 regionsnn
