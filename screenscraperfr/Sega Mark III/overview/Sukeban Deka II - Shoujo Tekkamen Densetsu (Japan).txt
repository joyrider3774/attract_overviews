Sukeban Deka II: Shoujo Tekkamen Densetsu ("Delinquent Girl Cop: Legend of the Maiden's Iron Mask") is a game based on the Sukeban Deka license, specifically that of the TV show remake in the 80s which was named Sukeban Deka II (which is why this game has no predecessor despite being a "II"). The series follows a Japanese schoolgirl who has chosen to fight crime after flaunting the law herself one too many times. Her only notable characteristic, as far as this game is concerned, is the use of a weaponized metal yo-yo to pummel her foes.
