As young Alex, your job is to go through an obstacle course and get to the main exit without other competitors trying to push you off your bike. You start out in Blackwood Forest, but depending on which scene you're in, you can travel to Cactus Desert, South Seas, Pyramid River, or Alex's home, Radaxian. More often than not, you must jump over water, and along the way, you can get power-ups such as more energy, more time, and jets that lets you fly through the scene, but only if you perform a wheelie can you get these power-ups. The game ends when you have no energy left.
