1993 saw the release of Puzzle game called Pipe Master II on the Amiga systems, created by Harald MÃƒÂ¼ller and published by Amiga Fantastic Software as a Coverdisk for free as a Public Domain.

In this puzzle game player has to construct pipeline connecting pipeline with... something. Not so random pipe pieces will appear, but nothing what you actually need. All in all, gameplay is non-existent, graphics are forgetable and sound is abysimal.

Game is utter rubbish, very sad, made even sadder by the fact that you can play Night Walk with more joy than this. Not sure what developer was thinking releasing this game. Avoid.
