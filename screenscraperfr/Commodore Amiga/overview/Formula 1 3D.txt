Formula 1 3D is a Racing game, developed and published by Simulmondo, which was released in Europe in 1991.

Simulmondo was running warm-up laps with Formula 1: They promise fast 3D action with variable detail, giving players the choice of true speed or high realism but at the end this was a wasted opportunity from Simulmondo to make a good racing simulation game. They mixed some arcade elements (timer, few laps, easy handling, no damage) with a bit of simulation. Unfortunately, the mix didn't get well and the result was a dull game (considering also that there was just only one circuit). On the other hand, the downs become up when played hotseat with a friend. Play it with some friends and game is really enjoyable.
