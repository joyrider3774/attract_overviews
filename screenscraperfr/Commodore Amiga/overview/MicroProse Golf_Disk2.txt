Simulation experts MicroProse also wanted to enter this game genre Ã¢â‚¬â€œ their answer was a serious golf simulation using a 3D vector graphics engine usually found only on their flight sims - the game was called Greens: The Ultimate 3-D Golf Simulation (In North America or MicroProse Golf in the rest of the world).

Greens: The Ultimate 3-D Golf Simulation is full of options. A dozen game types can be played on six different courses by up to four human players. A handicap system is included to allow novices and experts to play together. In one player mode the 'ranking list' allows players to play head-to-head against computer opponents of varying skill and rise in the ranks.

Hitting the ball is done using same control system pioneered in Leaderboard and used in most golf games. First click on the mouse button starts the back swing, second sets the force and final click sets the snap.

Greens: The Ultimate 3-D Golf Simulation is a great golf simulation for the Amiga. Its system requirements are modest meaning even A500 owners will be able to play it properly. Like other golf sims it's appeal is limited to fans of this genre, but for those looking for a good, challenging sports simulation, they could do much worse than selecting this golf game from the flight simulation experts.
