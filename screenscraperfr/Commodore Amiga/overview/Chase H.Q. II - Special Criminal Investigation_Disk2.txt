Chase H.Q. II: Special Criminal Investigation is a Racing game, developed by ICE Software and published by Ocean Software Ltd, which was released in 1990.

Your mission is to track down, chase and apprehend the dangerous criminals. It's FASTER - explosive power sends you bulleting through various terrains - hold the line or plough the fields. It's TOUGHER - the criminals wield some heavy hardware - but so do you! You can shoot but you must dodge their flak... heavy gunfire, trucks unloading their cargo onto your bonnet... it's the meanest pursuit game to hit the micro screen! The extra features will leave you gasping for extended play - weather changes, bodyguard squads, grenade-lobbing bikers, gun-choppers... just play it! We dare you to stop!
