In Goldrunner, a vertically scrolling shooter, earth has to be evacuated because of the damage caused by environmental pollution. Unfortunately the space ships have to pass through the world of Triton - and the inhabitants are unfriendly. So the obvious solution is to destroy the rings, huge space stations. A full frontal attack is without a change of success because the rings have to be destroyed from within. So the player is chosen to man a small space ship to do the job.
