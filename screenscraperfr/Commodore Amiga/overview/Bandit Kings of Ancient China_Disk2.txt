KOEI is justifiably famous for their superbly detailed historical war-games and Bandit Kings of Ancient China is no exception. Set in 12th Century China, Bandit Kings recreates a famous Chinese folk legend wherein 108 exiled heroes take up arms against the oppressive government with the twin goals of ousting the tyrannical Gao Qiu and restoring stability to the Empire.

KOEI takes war-gaming to new heights with super graphics and animation, highly realistic detail, and great sound, combined with a sophisticated, easy-to-use gaming system. One to seven players collaborate in playing out four separate scenarios with a cast of 255 characters - a different game every time you play.
