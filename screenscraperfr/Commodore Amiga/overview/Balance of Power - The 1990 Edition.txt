It has been several years since the release of the original Balance of Power. In that time the political voices in the world have changed dramatically. Now, in response to popular demand, master game designer Chris Crawford gives us Balance of Power: The 1990 Edition - a new and enhanced game of global politics and power struggles. Featuring a new multi-polar level, this game allows 80 countries to ship weapons and troops and fight wars. Your challenge as a superpower is to monitor their policies and use your influence - at times to the point of diplomatic crisis - to protect your interests.
