Kelly X is a space shoot 'em up played from a first person perspective. The player is a pilot working for the Peace Foundation (a future version of Greenpeace) whose task it is to search space for rogue nuke stations that illegally dump nuclear waste. The objective is simple: destroy the radioactive canisters and the stations as well as the guardian fighters that protect them.
