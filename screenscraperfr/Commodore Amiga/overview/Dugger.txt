Remember that Stoneage bloke? You know, the one with a sheepÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s head hairdo and one of them sledgehammer gadgies? Herbie Stone?

OK, now squeeze your mind really hard through about six time warpsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ nnurgggh! Right, now you should be back far enough to remember that very, very old coin-op, Dig Dug.

Put them together and you get a game all about digging tunnels and trying to destroy nasty aliens by dropping bricks on them or inflating them until they burst. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it.
Blows yer mind, eh?
