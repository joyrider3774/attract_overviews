High Steel is a combination of a platformer and a puzzle game. The player is a construction worker, one of the best at constructing skyscrapers out of pre-formed steel structures, who has now been called for a really tricky job. This building site has been infested with gremlins who make the job that much harder than it already is. The task at hand is simply to construct the buildings while not getting killed by the gremlins. To make it even trickier the contractor has set a time limit that has to be beaten.
