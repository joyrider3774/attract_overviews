In Hugo the player must complete a number of minigames and guessing games; most have 2.5D graphics and are controlled with button presses as Scylla the witch watches Hugo's progress and casts spells to stop him from reaching her lair in the Skull Cave at a mountain peak. During the games Hugo (voiced in Danish by Michael Brockdorf and German by Michael Habeck, Oliver Grimm and Oliver Baier) and Scylla (voiced in Danish by Winnie Engell and in German by Karin Kernke) communicate with the player with digitized speech, and can also knock on (or scratch) the screen from the inside, breaking the fourth wall.
