Funny Italian platform game based on a comic of the same name, the game consists of 10 levels in which Lupo Alberto (or Martha the hen, his girlfriend) must find a place to make love. 

You can choose whether to control Alberto, Martha or both simultaneously in two-player mode. The two characters have different characteristics, for example Marta can jump slightly higher. Occasionally they can also get weapons and other power-ups like protective helmets, shoes to go faster etc.
