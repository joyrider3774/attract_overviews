Hammer Boy is an Action game, developed and published by Dinamic Software, which was released in Europe in 1990.

Do you still remember those fun old games, with no plot, where you simply wanted to set the high score? Well Hammer Boy is a game just like that. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a boy with a hammer (I bet youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never guess that one) and your task is to protect the flag! The flag is flying on the top of the tower behind you and there are various enemies trying to take away. Every attack will last 99 seconds (see the counter in the top right corner) and then youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be taken to the next level.

The enemies will try to climb into your base or otherwise damage it (in level one you need to fight off the Indians climbing a wooden fort and shooting burning arrows; the second level takes you to a pirate ship; the third one takes place in a medieval castle; the fourth one in a moon base; and so on). Now as you advance, everything gets more difficult, but you also get more equipment. At the moon base you already get to shoot lasers (when standing to the most right, or most left position).

The graphics are nice enough, although the animation isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t as smooth as it could be. The boy isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t moving he simply disappears from one location and appears at the next one. The sound is nothing much, but it does the job.

Have fun! Tons of fun!
