Penthouse Hot Numbers is basically the same game as the publisher's previous Sexy Droids with new pictures; this time nude photographs from 15 Penthouse models.

Two opponents (the second either human or AI) compete on a 8x8 grid field. The players take turns and each one clicks on a field which has two effects: a part of the photograph is revealed and the player gets positive or negative points; depending on the field's colour. The catch is that one player can move the cursor only horizontally and the other is restricted to vertical movements. The game ends when no more moves are possible and the player with the most points wins.
