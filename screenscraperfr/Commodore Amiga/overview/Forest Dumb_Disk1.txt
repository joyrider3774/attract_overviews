Forest Dumb is a side-scrolling platform game. The aim for the player is to reach the designated number of coins and the exit gate before the time runs out. All the levels are quite extensive, full of hostile animals, deadly spikes or vanishing stone platforms. Besides the coins the player can collect numerous fruits (points) scattered around the board or use trampoline mushrooms to perform high jumps. The hostile creatures can be killed by a jump on their head. The player can use the quick run which increases the height of the jump. After each level a stage code is provided.
