This game deserves at least 2 prices, one for the shortest adventure I have ever played, and one for the sleaziest game I've ever seen on Amiga. Oh, yes, then it uses a quite rare 1st person view, but for a game of this type it makes it more interesting (rare in adventures).

The entire plot of the game can be described as this: You've met a nice girl at a meeting, and she has accepted your offer to stay the night with you. The point is simply to... Well, you know what it is. It turns out a little more complicated, because she reveals that she has a birthday the following day, and due to the meeting she's so exhausted that there's no chance in the evening. So you have to get up before her, and find some interesting birthday-presents for her, if you find the right presents (and get up in time) it's a home-run.

The game is quite easy, and can be solved in under an hour, but if you're not offended by erotics (and don't want to solve greater riddles like in Fascination) then this might turn out entertaining. Oh and just remember, she has a quite special taste in presents (that took some time for me to figure out...)

The game is made for adults, and it includes many explicit nude scenes with female protagonist.
