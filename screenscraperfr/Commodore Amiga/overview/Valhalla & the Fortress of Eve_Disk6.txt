The King of Valhalla, having rescued his kingdom from the evil clutches of The Lord of Infinity, has been ruling successfully over his now peaceful land for several years. With evil now far away, the young King has decided to find himself a wife, only to find out that all the eligible ladies have been kidnapped and taken to a fortress far from the borders of Valhalla.

The player's task is to guide the King through four massive levels, solving countless puzzles along the way, in order to free the women of Valhalla from the clutches of the Evil Witch Queen Eve. Within her fortress, the player will encounter a strange and mysterious world full of treachery and distraction. Does the player possess the intellect to outwit Eve and help the King of Valhalla find the woman of their dreams?

Unlike the first two Valhalla games, Valhalla and the Fortress of Eve is mouse-controlled. The player uses the mouse to walk through the game's environments, or to interact with objects. While exploring the scenery, the player will often come across locked doors, which need to be opened by flipping a switch. There are two bars on either side of the screen. One bar is your stamina. If this bar is empty, the player will die and will be have to restart the level. The other bar indicates, if the player manages to pick up a flask, how much time they have until the flask is empty.
