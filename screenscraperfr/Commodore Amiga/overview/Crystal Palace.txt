Crystal Palace is an Platform game, developed and published by Amiga Fun, which was released in Europe in 1993 on Amiga Fun Magazine as a Coverdisk. 

Quite an interesting concept, this game involves you using the sparks from your magic wand to break blocks that may be in your way. You can control where to point the wand too. Other than that, very basic. The presentation is good, in terms of graphics and music, but the actual gameplay is a bit slow-paced and difficult to get the hang of. In all fairness though, it's pretty good for a freebie.
