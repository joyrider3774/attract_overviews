Ice Runner is a Platform game, developed and published by Magic Soft, which was released in Europe in 1991.

Pretty decent Lode Runner variant in which you evade colour swapped clones of your player sprite, collect fruit, and then try to escape the level. I think the playability of Ice Runner is just right. On the other hand, the game lacks variety: There is only a single tile set for level graphics and there is only a single track of background music. The samples can get annoying after a while, too. You might want to turn off your Amiga's speakers and turn on some relaxing music from your stereo instead.
