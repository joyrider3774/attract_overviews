Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers for A1200 AGA machine is little less ugly and faster and is the best Amiga Street Fighter so far! You would be forgiven for thinking this is some dodgy shareware copyright infringing knock off, yet it is a fully licensed and US Gold backed game!

To be honest AGA version looks better than the A500 but not much. The backgrounds look poorly drawn lacking any animation with colour pallets that look like they date back to the late 80's, while the fighters have shrunk dramatically lacking detail and character, but for everything it lacks in visual fidelity it makes up in speed and smoothness. A1200 version is treated to some enhanced visuals such as overlayed power bars, but also you will hit the holy grail of 50fps which will have you forgiving the game for being so ugly! Up the turbo speed, throw it into NTSC mode and hold on tight!

Sound is present and accounted for giving music and SFX at the same time, and while nothing brilliant it manages to preserve the arcade feel. Increased speed means the game play is right up there with the arcade version resulting in some frantic rounds.

No game's worth this amount of disk accessing. The game's fast flowing, punchy and varied, but let down by terrible sound, minute graphics and terrible, TERRIBLE disk accessing. You'd have to be a big fan to forgive all its problems.
