Boondar is actually based on an old CBM64 and Spectrum smash-hit game called Bounder. The aim of the game is a simple one, yet a brilliant one; you are a ball, and must get to the end of a huge scrolling course. See? Excellent!

There are number of stepping stones along the way, some of which allow you to bounce on them as many times as you like, while others will dissolve away, leaving you to fall to your death. Other obstacles to be avoided include the many hedges that block your way, along with the odd nasty thing that plops in front of you and jumps up and down. To help you along the way, there are number of bonus tiles (shown with a Ã¢â‚¬Å“?Ã¢â‚¬Â) which, once bounced on, will award varying effects.

Anyway, the joystick controls everything, and other than getting used to the bounce delay and the way the ball reacts to various tiles, it's all pretty damn simple! Have fun, courtesy of The One.
