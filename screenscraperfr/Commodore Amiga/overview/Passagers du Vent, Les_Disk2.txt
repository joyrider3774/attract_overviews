Based on Francois Bourgeon's French comic book series from the '80s, the game follows the series' plot very closely.

The adventure takes place on the eve of the French revolution, during the time that a regular slave trade between France, America and Africa was at its height. Hoel, a sailor flees France when falsely accused of murder along with Isa (the usurped countess). Their missions are for him to clear his name, and for her to regain her titles. This they do after travelling through many lands, and as the player, you must find the right solutions in order to progress through all ten 'chapters' of the story.

The secret of any successful game HAS to be smooth operation of the vital process of making the game run. In Passengers on the Wind this does not happen. That apart, the music and sound effects are very impressive, and make full use of the Amiga's facilities in this department. In the opening scene, you hear seagulls calling and waves crashing, and even a choral sound in the music score. The graphics are not Amiga state-of-the-art, but are adequate.

I am very disappointed with this release, Francois Bourgeon may well be a very talented writer and artist, but Infogrammes have not really done him justice.
