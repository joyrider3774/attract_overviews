Suburban Commando is a mix of space shooter, jump-and-run and beat-em-up. Based on the Hulk Hogan film Suburban Commando (1991), the game is a wild mix of space shooter, platform jumping and beat-em-up action.

Loosely following the storyline of the film, Hogan alias intergalactic hero Shep Ramsey travels through space, crash-lands on earth and beats up the bad guys. The first level is a R-Type-like horizontal space shooter; destroy formations of drones and collect weapon upgrades. After that, you'll enter three platform levels, in which you have to find nine items each. Avoid being shot and dispatch the enemies with kicks and jumps. After each mission, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll encounter the level boss, who youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re supposed to beat up in a Street Fighter clone.
