Oh look, it's yet another budget SWIV rip-er, tribute. This time you're flying a chunky black bomber thing, and the major difference between this and every other vertically-scrolling shoot-'em-up is that your plane carries bombs instead of guns. You can buy all the usual power-ups from shops scattered around the landscape, but you have to choose quickly as you can still be shot and damaged while your plane sits on the runway conveniently placed outside the shop. Which is a bloody stupid idea if you ask me.

Graphically the game is very pretty, but soundwise it's a complete nightmare, with a choice given at the start between grating sound effects reminiscent of a Spectrum game loading, unlistenably awful music, or blissful complete silence. As for gameplay, well, no there isn't any.

Black Hornet was obviously written by someone with no grasp of the mechanics of what makes a good shoot-'em-up, and the endlessly repetitive nature of the enemy landscape and attacks will very probably send you to sleep before you get anywhere near the end of the first level. If you do manage that, you'll find yourself in a second level which is almost identical to the first one only green.
