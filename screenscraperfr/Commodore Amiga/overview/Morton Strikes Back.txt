If this game looks vaguely familiar, that's probably because you've seen it before, only it was called Smidge which we reckoned was  far better than most full-price games.

Morton Strikes Back is accessible with addictive gameplay and super smooth parallax scrolling, over 80 levels across 11 different worlds, many difficulty levels'. It is a platform game featuring a Mr Man type character with the legs and rickets. And penguins. As far as platform games go, there's little new or exciting about Morton. You jump on baddies' heads to kill them, collect corns and fruit for points, hearts to regain lost hit points. You start off at the left, head right and occasionally there are secret rooms to be found. The only major difference of course is the penguins.

The plain fact is that if you really feel like you need another platform game then you should download it right now, and of course you get penguins in it.
