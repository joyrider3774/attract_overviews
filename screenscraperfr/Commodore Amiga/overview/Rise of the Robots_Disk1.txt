Rise of the Robots emerges from the hype and reveals itself as a good-looking but rather unwieldy beat-em-up. The game, in all of the currently available versions, is just not that good.

In terms of pure beat-em-up action, Rise of the Robots is outclassed by the barely-better-than-16-bit BODY BLOWS games. ROTR is quite poor in the "special moves" area of beat-em-up gaming. The graphics? Well... the animations are good. The characters, when still, look very good too. When moving they are anything but realistic looking. Their movements are jerky and very repetitive. What's different in each version? Not a lot. All of them suffer from the poor control and jerky animation.

The non-AGA version takes less time to install on the hard drive than the AGA version because some of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“cinematicsÃ¢â‚¬Â have been taken out. They're not much of a loss really. This version also looks pretty good considering the number of colors onscreen. It seems to play a tad faster too.

Disappointment is the key word here. The game promised so much and delivered so little. I guess one good thing is that, for once, the PC suffers from the exact same problems.
