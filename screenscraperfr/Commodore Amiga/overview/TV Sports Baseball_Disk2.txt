TV Sports: Baseball is an arcade oriented conversion of the popular American sport, in the same series as TV Sports: Football and TV Sports: Basketball. The player can choose among 26 teams and play directly in the positions of batter and pitcher. A managerial element is also included: when playing a whole season the player can choose the lineup and the batting order.

Emphasis is put on user-friendliness and TV-style presentation, featuring the likeness of Bob McGill. It also features digitalised sound samples and motion captured player animations. The stats can be consulted from the main menu.
