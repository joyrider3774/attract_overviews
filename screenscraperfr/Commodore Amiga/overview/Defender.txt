Your mission, as captain of the "Defender" ship, is to protect the humanoids stranded on the planet from their alien abductors. This is a very nice program and an excellent attempt by a Defender fan to replicate the exact arcade game on an Amiga. It is a nice addition to the Amiga arcade library, much better then Defender II, just excellent!
