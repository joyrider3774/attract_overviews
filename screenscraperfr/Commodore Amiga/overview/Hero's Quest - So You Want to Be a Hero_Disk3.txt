Quest for Glory I: So You Want to Be a Hero (also known as Quest for Glory: So you Want to Be a Hero or Quest for Glory I Original: So You Want To Be A Hero and Quest For Glory I - Original) is the first game of the Quest for Glory Series, an adventure game/role-playing game hybrid, designed by Lori Ann Cole and published by Sierra On-line. It was originally known as Hero's Quest: So You Want To Be A Hero. The game was rereleased as Quest for Glory because of trademark issues involving the HeroQuest boardgame by Milton Bradley. Hero's Quest I/Quest for Glory I has been credited for being a genre-inventing game, as no other game before it had tried to mix adventure gaming with role-playing-like elements such as statistic building (strength, intelligence, health) that would actually have an impact on the ability to accomplish certain parts of the game.
