Galaxy Fight: The Incredible Space Fight is a Shooter game, developed by SoftTouch and published by RONO, which was released in Europe in 1987.

The art style might be a bit drab, but for a game this early in the life cycle of the Amiga, it is acceptable. The game runs at reasonable speed and features a very short title track. The downsides are: just 5 short levels that loop forever, no power-ups, no bosses, and no in-game music. What is there is competent but it leaves you wanting to play something a bit more fleshed-out and more exciting.
