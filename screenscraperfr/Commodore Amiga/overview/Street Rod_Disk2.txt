Street Rod is a car racing game with a difference - and loads of atmosphere as well. It's set in the days when cars were really cars and milk bars were really milk bars. First you'll have to buy your car - look through the classified ads in the newspaper on the screen. Then get to work in the body-shop - maybe a new paint job in something tasteful like hot pink. Then it's out with the engine. A workshop screen lets you pull it to pieces, make timing adjustments and add high performance parts.

Then it's off to the race track. A cruise down the main street to show off your wheels will always result in a challenge - and usually there's a little wager on the side. The race sequences are difficult, and you only get one chance. Crash your car and it's back to the body repair shop. Not only that, your bank balance drops alarmingly. You can use joystick or mouse controls - I'm still not sure which I like best, but I suspect the joystick gives the best Ã¢â‚¬Å“feelÃ¢â‚¬Â.

Graphics are very nice, music is atmospheric - all in all, Street Rod is a hot game.
