Arachnophobia is a Platform game, developed by Blue Sky Software and published by Disney Interactive Studios, which was released in 1991.

This arcade type game has you as an exterminator who must kill the infestation of spiders that have invaded the towns. When you find the queen and kill it, you can then go to the next town to do your extermination.

Each town consists of about 15 houses all of which are infested with spiders but only one house has the queen. You enter the house of your choice and walk through each room killing all the spiders. You are armed with poison that you squirt on the spiders to kill them. You can also jump on them squishing them but this is more risky because itâ€™s easier for you to get bitten. Get bitten 3 times and you will die. You also have a can of super poison. Pressing the spacebar releases the can of poision and can kill all the spiders in a room. You only have a limited number of these so you must use them sparingly. If you kill all the spiders in the house you are congratulated by sampled speech and put back into the neighborhood ready to enter the next house.

The graphics are decent and the sound is very good. There is some humorous sampled speech throughout the game. The game plays extremely well and the difficulty level is perfect. The game gets harder with each town that you go to.

In conclusion, this is a very good and fun game. The game has a very cartoony feel to it but it also feels realistic in many ways. I really canâ€™t say anything bad about this game, so this game gets a definite thumbs up! Very playable + very funny, + very fun = very good game!
