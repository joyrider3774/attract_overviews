Galaga '92 is a Shooter game developed by Geert Coelmont and Romain Voes, published as a PD/Freeware and was released in Europe in 1992.

Play Galaga '92, and find out how it will take possession of you. Almost 300 different animation-frames in 16 colors, many many levels (nobody exactly knows how much!) with END-OF-STAGE-NASTIES, bonus-levels, kamikaze-raids, and of course more aliens than the Galaxy has ever seen before! Galaga '92 is the ULTIMATE game. Slowly but steadily, it will take the mind out your soul, leaving you playing the game until you drop to the floor.
