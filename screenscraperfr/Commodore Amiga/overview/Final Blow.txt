Final Blow is a Sports game, developed by Taito Corporation and published by Storm, which was released in Europe in 1991.

Up until now, the only semi-decent boxing sim has been the humble Spectrum version of EliteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Frank Bruno game. However, in converting Final Blow, Storm have taken the risk and, to an extent, pulled it off.  Somehow, though, Storm have managed to inject a modicum of playability into the Amiga game, creating a repetitive but playable conversion.

The original coin-op sported five boxers, each of whom had to be beaten before the title was yours. StormÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s game, however, now sports a tournament, a two-player mode and an expanded gym of ten would-be champs. The actual bouts against these guys takes place over two rounds within a horizontally-scrolling ring, with the playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on-screen persona represented by one of the largest sprites the Amiga has housed.

There are a variety of punches available, ranging from uppercuts to head blows and blocks, and these are all easily accessed using the joystick and fire button. In addition, if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re coming off worse during a scuffle, the ref will come in and break you up or you can leap out of the fray.

WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s there is well done, however, somehow I get the feeling that, even if Storm had added more moves to the existing ones, the game would still boil down to the same thing. Entertaining enough in the short-term, and undoubtedly better than the coin-op. Final Blow is the best of its kind but a feather-weight in the lasting appeal department.
