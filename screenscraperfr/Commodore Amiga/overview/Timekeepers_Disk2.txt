Timekeepers is hybrid strategy and puzzle game. It plays like a cross between Lemmings and a RTS like Dune 2. The main game screen has a row of icons at the bottom, timekeepers' portraits at each side and at the center a scrolling map of the level. The platoon is autonomous, the player can't control it directly but instead has to place icons on the map to order the troops. A soldier will try to perform an action while passing over an icon.
