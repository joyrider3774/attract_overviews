Franko: The Crazy Revenge is a Beat Ã¢â‚¬ËœEm Up game, developed by World Software and published by Mirage, which was released in Europe in 1994.

Alex and Franko were a pair of great friends, born in times where Poland was morphing from communist country into something else. Lost in the world, they couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find them self in the new reality. Living in the Polish city of Szczecin, the two were growing up in a rather unfriendly neighborhood. Mastering martial arts, they found their life tough but very interesting. Until one day a band of thugs attacked them. After a long fight, when Franko was able to see and feel again, he saw a body of his friend, and in his ears he still heard the laughter of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leader, Klocek. Now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time for revenge.

Franko is a classical Double Dragon-style action game. With excessive amount of blood and violence, it is suitable for mature audiences only. The player walks right through the streets of a Polish city. On his way, he faces various kinds of enemies, from punks, through karatekas, to infamous Communist law enforcement groups like ZOMO. The enemies can be fought with a variety of hand-to-hand blows and moves, though some of them carry guns.

Yep, third-worldly production values and Village-People-like characters, but it still fared better than many triple-A titles (not that the Amiga had so many triple-A beat'em ups to speak of anyway). The guys should have broken it down into shorter levels, though. And checked a couple of bugs that caused level bosses to walk off-screen and make it impossible to continue. But they did get the insanely violent mood right.
