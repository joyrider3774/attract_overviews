Yo! Joe! Beat the Ghosts is a platform game featuring two characters. The protagonists can jump, crawl, kick, beat, slide, and swim. They are even able to hold their breath when under water. If you are playing the game solely, "Joe" is your character of choice. A friend can take on Nat's part at the same PC.
