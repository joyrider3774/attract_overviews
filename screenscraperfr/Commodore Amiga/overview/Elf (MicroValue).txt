Cornelius the Elf was living peacefully in a forest with his sweetheart Elisa. However, an evil creature known as Necrilous the Not-Very-Nice kidnapped Elisa and disappeared with her. Cornelius must embark on a perilous journey to rescue the love of his life.

Elf is a platform game which almost crosses into the adventure genre. You play an elf who is out to destroy Necrilous the Not-Very-Nice. It's resonably non-linear areas in that you can go back and forth between areas.

You collect items during play and get access to different spells and attacks.
