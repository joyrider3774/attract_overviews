A conversion of the cult fave arcade rave. It's effectively Bubble Bobbie in a snowy clime but with a few appropriate twists and some neat cartoon visuals. It looks and plays identically to its arcade parent - well, save for the absence of the simultaneous two player option (it wasn't implemented because the action would have slowed down from the ideal running speed). Although scheduled for release in mid-1991 and completed, the Amiga conversion was never published. Later, the game was rediscovered and released for free.
