CrossCheck is a hockey game which is played from a top-down perspective. Players can take control over one of ten national teams and participate either in a friendly match or a league (two divisions with five teams each). Each athlete has three stats which influence his performance on the ice; players have the option to change the lineup or make substitutions during a match. The focus of the game is on fast-paced matches which can be customized with a few options, e.g. if fouls and offsets are avenged or the length of a match. Players have control over the athlete which has the nearest position to the puck.
