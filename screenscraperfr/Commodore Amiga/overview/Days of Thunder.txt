As Cole Trickle you're in the race for the Stock Car Championship Trophy against 20 other Stock Car drivers. Before each race a qualification round determines your position on the grid for the race.

Finish a race with a fast enough lap speed and it's onto the next circuit. Cole's sponsor, Harry Hogge, sends through telegrams judging your performance throughout the Championship. The Amiga version has external viewpoints including Sky Cam and trackside views along with options to define the number cars (from 5 to 20) and laps (a minimum of 10), parade lap length and level of detail. A Player vs Player modem facility is also offered. For the race itself, the Amiga version has a first-person perspective.
