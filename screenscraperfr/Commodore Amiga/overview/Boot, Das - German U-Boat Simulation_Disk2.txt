Based on the classic German film of the same name this is a submarine simulation set during WW2. Despite being made in 1990 and therefore primarily designed for the A500 I was surprised to find that the game not only detects and makes use of faster (020+) processors but also promotes to run on VGA monitors.

Control is via the mouse and keyboard and as with all such games there are many keys to learn if you want to become proficient in the game. That said the game is quite accessible without a deep knowledge of these keys. The game menu offers 8 training modes; 4 above and 4 below the surface.

The 6 included scenarios follow the film plot and range from the fjord patrol through operations in the North Atlantic to Gibraltar and the Mediterranean. Difficulty levels are available with the selection of such parameters as torpedo reliability, spares availability and repair states.

On the down side the game suffers from the same problem that inflicts all sub sims, namely lack of action. However, since this is a generic problem and not just akin to this game it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it any worse than itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peers.

As a game, whilst it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t become a member of my "top tier" it certainly has earned a place on my hard drive and the right to remain there. This is a game which has changed my views on sub sims due to its playability and nice graphics. So if like me youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tried sub sims before but never really liked them, try this game out  If you give it a chance it may just change your opinion of the genre too.
