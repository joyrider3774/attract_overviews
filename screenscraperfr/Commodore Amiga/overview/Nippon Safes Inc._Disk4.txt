Nippon Safes, Inc. is the predecessor to Big Red Adventure, with both being cartoon adventure games by Italian developer Dynabyte. As with the follow-up, players take the role of three different heroes - Doug, the smart safe cracker; Dino, the strong, but dumb, boxer; and Donna, the sexy club dancer. 

The game takes place in Tokyo. While all three characters explore almost the same areas, each of the heroes has their own story to follow and puzzles to solve. You can choose which character you would like to play first and when you have finished all three sub-plots, you'll get a final with all three characters acting altogether.

The game features cartoonish, comics-style graphics, unique icon-based interface and non-linear plot. It is also full of Italian humour, and the game is played more like a comedy, rather then crime-based adventure.
