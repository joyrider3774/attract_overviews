Truckin On II is a 2-4 player game with the object to make more money than your opponent over a given time period. Each player is allocated $10,000 to start a Truckin Company.

A knowledge of the trucks capacity and fuel consumption is required and this can be obtained at the relevant truckyard. Also an indication of the trucks mileage capacity is indicated at the Service Station. Their are a number of pitfalls which may be encounted on the road but these are self explanatory and require little reference.
