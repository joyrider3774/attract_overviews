Being fairly young in gaming years, to me Kings Quest I seems very basic especially by todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s standards. But IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure there are those of you out there who remember the good olÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ days of RPGs, having to type in the commands for your hero, spending hours trying to find another word for Ã¢â‚¬ËœwalkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ because your computer is having one of his pedantic days and waiting on eternity for each screen to load when your character moves from one area to another. Well, I bet some of the more nostalgic among you are now saying Ã¢â‚¬ËœHey, I remember those old classicsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ - and Kings Quest I is definitely one of them.

The King of Daventry is on his last legs, and you, as his favourite Knight Sir Graham, need to retrieve three missing treasures to restore Daventry to its former glory and be rewarded with the crown. For your money you get some reasonable graphics, and some nice effects such as birds tweeting in the background, monsters splashing in the moat and waterfall.

Controlling the game is relatively easy, type in whatever instruction you wish your character to carry out and the computer will either let you do this or suggest that you try something else.

If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a real RPG fan then itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth a look. The game isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t too bad, but at the moment there are far more original and impressive adventure games around, and it canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t compete with todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high standards.
