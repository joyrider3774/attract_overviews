The player is required to select one side 'A' or 'B' in the conflict, and keep the save game for each pilot on a separate floppy.
Each pilot you can fly different missions and aircraft, but only those from your own side.

The player character flies from three land bases and two aircraft carriers on each side, and these bases can be damaged in several ways by enemy action, making them unavailable until repaired and reducing the available aircraft in the campaign.
Mission types are:
air intercept
air superiority
long range bombing
bomber escort
close support and ground attack
border or sea patrol
reconnaissance
troop drop
supply drop
stealth bombing
stealth reconnaissance
test pilot
An autopilot mode is available for longer cruises, if the enemies are far off. The 'test pilot' mission involves flying the X-15/X-29 and is not a part of the campaign.
