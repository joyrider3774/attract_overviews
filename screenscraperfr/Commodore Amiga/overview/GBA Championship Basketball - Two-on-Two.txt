GBA Championship Basketball can be played as one or two players vs. the computer or two players with computer teammates and includes Practice Play. Draft your teammates from a list of ten players whose styles are patterned after real professional superstars. Practice with games like "Around the world" and "Horse", or go one-on-one with a friend. You play GBA Basketball on a full court. And when it comes to shooting, you have a full range of choices, like hook shots, tip-ins, jumpshots and even dunks. After each game, you can read the sports page of the Gamestar Gazette to check box scores and division standings.
