Skara Brae is in ruins. Someone - or some thing - has sealed the city's fate with an evil so vast, so unspeakable, that a host of Paladins and an army of Archmages are outmatched. Hard times call for subtlety. Smaller is better. Sneakier is better. What the world needs now is a thief. The Thief of Fate.
