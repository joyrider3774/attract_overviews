The Norse Kingdom is threatened by the Iniquitous Hel, goddess of Niflheim and purveyor of evil. Thor, the great god of law and order, has been selected by his fellow gods to travel through four Norse worlds in an attempt to stop Hel spreading evil and ruling his people. The journey will be long and ardulous. Hel has sent creatures to meet Thor, delay his progress, and kill him. A variety of pitfalls and traps await him.

Fire and Brimstone is a 2D Jump N Run released in 1990 for the Amiga & Atari ST very similar to Ghost'n'Goblins.
