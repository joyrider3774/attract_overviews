The year is 2016 and being a pilot is always a risky job, especially when flying test aircraft. To cut a long story short, a bizarre accident sends the experimental plane out of control and causes you to pass out. When you come around you find yourself in a strange world.

Play takes place on a gigantic scrolling map which tends to consist mostly of forests and mountain ranges, all of which are there to be explored. As time goes on the sun sets and the moon comes up - the land is even more dangerous at night. At night time make sure you sleep indoors. Don't just bed down on a makeshift camp because the chances are you'll never wake up - death comes easy to strangers in this mysterious world!
