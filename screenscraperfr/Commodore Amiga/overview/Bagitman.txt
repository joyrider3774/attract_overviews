Bagitman is an arcade platformer. The player controls the name-giving Bagitman through several mine shaft levels composed of three screens each, his goal is to pick up money bags and put them into a wheelbarrow at the surface of the mine. Obstacles are pursuing guards, ore carts, and elevators. The only means of defence is a pickaxe, which stuns a guard temporarily. The same happens when the player manages to drop a money bag on top of a guard.
