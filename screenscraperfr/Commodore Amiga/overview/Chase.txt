This Amiga offering from Mastertronic leaves a lot to be desired. First off it is just too fast to be played easily. All the graphics in the game are vectors, and very well handled they are so fast. The levels are very Star Warsesque. Level one is an asteroid field, in level two you have to avoid the towers on the planet, whilst in level three you fly down a winding tunnel. Level four Ã¢â‚¬â€œ avoid oncoming obstacles in a trench. Chase is a very poor offering and one we can't really recommend.
