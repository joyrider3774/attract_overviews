The sequel to Another World; combining the two-dimensional filled vector graphics of the original and beautiful rotoscoped characters, giving a realism of movement in the animation of the main character not seen since Broderbund's Prince of Persia. It's a large game, too, with an intriguing plotline and fine attention to detail. The fluidity of the graphics make it a great game to watch as well as play.
