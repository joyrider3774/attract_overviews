Bomb Busters is a variant of the arcade game Bomb Jack. It's a single screen platform game where the player has to collect a number of bombs. At any time one of the bombs will blink meaning that it is active and will soon explode. These active bombs are worth more points when collected but the risk is higher since the player will die if caught within the blast radius. In this version the player character doesn't fly but has a jetpack allowing him to move vertically. In addition to exploding bombs there are also various enemies moving around that are lethal to touch. Various bonus items can be collected: B's for extra points, P's for Pac-Man-like invulnerability and L's for extra lives.

The game also has an unusual two player mode where both players cooperate in controlling a single character. How this should work can be set up before starting the game. Each player can be handled different parts of the control. For example one player moves left and the other right. It's also possible to set it up so that both player has to do the same thing at the same time. So to jump both player has to press the their jump buttons at the same time.
