This game is based on the wonderful '93-94 season of the English Premier League Championship. Which is, of course, the year when Manchester United won both the English league and FA cup in the same season. Hence Ã¢â‚¬Å“The DoubleÃ¢â‚¬Â in the name of the game. But don't let this fool you, you can choose to play any team from the top 5 leagues of the English game. Also you can customize any team or player in the league to fit your liking. Not that it gets any better than Keane, Giggs and Cantona though...

The statistical side if the game is impressive, as is the tactical. Both are quite simple and straight-forward, but still lets an advanced manager fiddle around a lot. You choose formation, players, arrange transfers and of course play games.

The matches are similar to what it looks and feels like in Kick Off 3 or even Sensible soccer. Graphics are OK but not more, the sound actually has some crowd noises and chants. If you listen closely you'll hear: Ã¢â‚¬Å“United, UnitedÃ¢â‚¬Â. Not surprising perhaps but it does make the matches more lively.

Controls during the games are good, but it's quite hard to score in your first games. Keep going though and you'll find that it can be done, but you'll hardly get many Ã¢â‚¬Å“crazyÃ¢â‚¬Â results against top-level opposition. The heading of the ball is a bit strange as the players look to jump about 5 meters up in the air, and have a hang-time that would make Michael Jordan jealous.

This was the third in Krisalis series of United games, it's also the best in my opinion. Not a true classic but you can challenge a friend or have some tough games anyway. Fighting your way through the friendlies, cups and leagues with your favourite team is really fun. A recommended download for anyone that enjoys football games.
