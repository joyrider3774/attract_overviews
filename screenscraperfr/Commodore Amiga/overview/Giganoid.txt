Giganoid (in case you hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t guessed) is a variation on the Break-Out/Arkanoid formula, with 50 screens of block groups to destroy. This is an Action game, developed and published by Swiss Computer Arts, which was released in Europe in 1988.

The number of Arkanoid clones on the 16-bit machines is already remarkable, and here, complete with Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ- anoidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ suffix, is yet another. Indeed, Giganoid is the most blatant version yet, with identical bat, bonus capsules, and screen surrounds. Stand by for a possible joint Imagine/Taito legal case against Swiss Computer Arts! The game of Giganoid itself, though, is unlikely to cause any ripples, as it is just the usual very competently programmed affair with no real improvements over Impact, my own favorite of the genre. Anyone who hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seen the many other interpretations of the theme should be well impressed with Giganoid, but only an unusual highscore table screen with impressive rotating coloured bars and didgeridoo samples stick in my mind.

If you already have the Imagine original or AudiogenicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impressive Impact, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bother with Giganoid, if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, this is the one to check out.

Cheats:
On the player select screen, press the Ã¢â‚¬ËœCAPS LOCKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ key, so the key light is on. Now press and hold the Ã¢â‚¬ËœCAPS LOCKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and press fire. A message should appear letting you know the cheat is active. If you held down the fire button a little to long the game may have started and bypassed the message, but you should notice you have a lot of lives.
