If you have never heard of Jeff Minter, or "Attack of the Mutant Camels" then you have lived a sheltered life. Minter's games have a simple approach to things. You shoot them. The graphics in Super Grid Runner are simple, colourful and flash so brightly that any life form more advanced than humans (dolphins, mice and so on) may find that actual pain is induced. Sounds are similarly psychedelic and when amplified are almost, but not quite, totally unlike a Disaster Area concert. There are a large number of levels with which the earth creature may choose to begin the mindless destruction. These proceed with a definite lack of seriousness. Some might say they are fun. They would be right. They are indeed, as they say, fun.
