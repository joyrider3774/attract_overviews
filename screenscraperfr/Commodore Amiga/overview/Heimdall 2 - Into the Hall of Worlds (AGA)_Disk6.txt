The player travels through different lands of Nordic Worlds, fighting with enemies (with sword, bow and arrow or magic) and solving puzzles that are mostly about finding an object and bringing it to the person who needs it, figuring out the proper combination of some items or goods or finding a way through the maze. During the game you can change the character between man and woman.
