The 1994 edition of Holiday Lemmings is the second full game in the series of Christmas-themed Lemmings games, after two free demos in 1991 and 1992 and a commercial 1993 version.

Gameplay is unchanged from the original game: players are tasked with leading a horde of Lemmings to the level exit by assigning them special abilities. The holiday theme shows in snow-covered landscapes, the Lemmings wearing Christmas outfits and appropriate background music. The game includes 32 all-new levels, grouped into two difficulties: Frost and Hail. It also comes with all 32 levels from the 1993 version (Flurry and Blizzard difficulties).
