The wizards are revolting (and it's not just their personal habits). Whichever one passes the test of IOZU will become the grand master and dominate the rest. To pass this test the wizard has to defeat the dark side of his spirit by completing a series of memory puzzles. A pattern is displayed at the start of each level, which then has to reproduced by you. Unlike most games you don't control the pieces. Instead you operate a little wizard who has to scurry around collecting the pieces of the pattern as they fall from the heavens and then place them on board. The presentation is very slick. There's a good intro with sampled sound and a snazzy picture. The menu screen has a couple of finely animated dragons and there's an option that lets you trade gold (points) for tips which is another nice touch. 

Brain Blasters is fun to begin with, but after the fifth level, or so, the novelty value begins to pale. There's a two-player mode where a couple of wizards can battle it out for the pieces but even this becomes boring. Devotees of memory puzzles in The Express will probably like this, otherwise you'd be well-advised to try before you buy.
