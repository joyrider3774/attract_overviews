Femme Fatale is an Adult Puzzle game, developed by Raffi Demerjian and published by Graphic Expressions, which was released in Europe in 1989.

Femme Fatale is nothing more than a memory puzzle by Raffi Demerjian. After a complicated workmanship in various menus, the Graphic Expressions presents one of ten different beauties on the screen, which is then divided into many individual parts, depending on the difficulty level. Now, you need to arrange the lady again correctly, on request, with acoustic support of a sexy ladies voice. After the work is done, you can open (in a further menu) next piece you need - and that's it.
