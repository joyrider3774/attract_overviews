Borobodur: The Planet of Doom is an Action game, developed by Softeyes and published by Thalamus, which was released in Europe in 1992.

As a platform and blast adventure, you must progress through all levels by collecting the various icons scattered at the most inconvenient of places. Who put the required object on a platform that demands a super-hyper jump from a dangerously high-up ledge?

It's not all run, jump and shoot, though. Sub-levels include a puzzle game against the computer where you shuffle square blocks about a board in an attempt to recreate the original pattern. There's also a turbo bike section, featuring an Outrun/Lotus perspective. Final words: Frustratingly slow and tedious with minimal action.
