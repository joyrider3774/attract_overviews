After BullyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sporting Darts proved the level of excellence which could be achieved in the field of Darts simulation, it was with baited breath that Jocky WilsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Compendium of Darts was placed into the drive. Just imagine, another darts game which included variations on the theme. What a let down then when we discovered that the game stank to high heaven. It must be said that this was only a first impression, the game does actually grow on you a little (and I stress the little part), but in comparison to BullyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, this doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even come close. The control is extremely jerky, so much so that it would not be unreasonable to assume that Jocky has downed at least 15 pints as his hand is all over the show.

Another problem is that the games are far too simplistic, I mean come on, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take a great deal of thought to work out how to get a ten dart century now does it! Perhaps its predecessor has made us expect too much from this type of game, but this really doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t warrant a purchase.
