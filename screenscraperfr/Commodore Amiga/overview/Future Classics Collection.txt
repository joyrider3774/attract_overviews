The Future Classics Collection is a collection of five distinctly-themed games that stress action and strategy equally. The programmers of the games had previously worked for Cinemaware and MicroProse.

The gameplay options are also quite varied: Each game can be played one player alone, two players alternately, two players simultaneously, or one player against one of three computer personalities -- including split-screen play for head-to-head competition.
