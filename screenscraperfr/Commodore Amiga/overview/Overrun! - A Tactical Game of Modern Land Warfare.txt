Overrun! is, to quote the cover, 'a tactical game of modern land warfare' spanning combat in the Arab/Israeli October War of '73, present day and future Middle East conflict and of course the next BIG battle -- conventional war in Central Europe.

Variety is the spice of life but Overrun! isn't too hot in flavour, with only the 8 Middle East and Central Europe hypothetical scenarios. Game is very high challenging across the board to keep you sweating, and at times very vicious. It is open-ended with the future war scenarios, but satisfyingly gritty Middle East combat.

The 'what if' potential of Overrun! is one of the game's strong points and through this the player gets to create history rather than recreate it. The mechanics of play work as well as any other recent SSI game, but the potential for extensive coverage of modern conflicts has been missed.
