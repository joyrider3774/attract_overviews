Welcome to the wild world of the 600cc Sportsbikes! Gathered for your personal revue are four of the hottest, street-legal, two wheeled monsters to blast down any canyon. You get to take the Suzuki Katana, the Kawasaki Ninja, the Yamaha FXR, and the Honda Hurricane, and put them through their paces.

You will get the opportunity to discover the feel of each of these bikes as you race the clock on the road course, and sprint against the stopwatch on the dragstrip. Time is the ultimate standard by which you can judge these motorcycles; the fastest mass production cycles in this class!
