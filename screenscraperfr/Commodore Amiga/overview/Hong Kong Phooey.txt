It's Hong Kong Phooey, No. 1 Super Guy! Baron Von Bankjob has escaped from jail! Who comes to the rescue? It's Hong Kong Phooey, emerging from the sticky top drawer of his special file cabinet, with the help of trusty police station cat, Spot!

Another could-have-been-OK Hannah-Barberra release from Hi-Tec; for a budget game this would be quite respectable if weren't for the sluggish controls which render it pretty much unplayable -- there's a huge delay between moving the joystick up and Hong Kong jumping, which makes for frustrating gameplay: even with the cheat you'd have to have the patience of a saint to play this for too long. A pity, as the music is quite catchy and the graphics aren't bad.
