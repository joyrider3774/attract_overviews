Well it's all about saving doomed planets, generating a fabulous party of characters, having the odd barney chances are you've been down a similar road before. So. Gather a gang, get a liberal sprinkle of characters - doctors, diplomats, complete nutters - and travel the galaxy. Chance meetings at the right time provide the route to success.

Mega Traveler 2 is huge and detailed, though it looks a little basic. But it remains a slightly above average RPG.  It is a very faithful adaptation of the Traveller role-playing game with over 100 fully explorable planets (most with multiple cities and each with it's own sub-quests) and a non-linear story line.
