Level 9's answer to the Infocom's Zork, this trilogy includes Lords of Time, Red Moon, and The Price of Magik, all of which center around wizards and spells. Despite the name "trilogy" these games do not share the same plot thread. Lords of Time has the best plot in this series: you must journey through time to collect various objects to defeat the Lord of Time. Red Moon and Price of Magik have more mundane plots, but the spell-related puzzles keep things interesting.
