Diego Maradona World Football Manager is a Sports game, developed and published by Sayonara, which was released in Europe in 1992.

Well, the second Sayonara manager offers essentially the same. In fact, the differences in two games are hard to be missed, even though there are some: There are only twelve countries in the game and there is even an autoplay mode in which you only have to watch. Only the very extensive statistics section can convince in comparison with the strong competition among other football managers..

Conclusion: As a PD it would be in order, but as a commercial game, Diego is far from a great football manager title.

Avoid.
