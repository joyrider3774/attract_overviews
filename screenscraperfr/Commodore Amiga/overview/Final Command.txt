Communication between two planets has ceased and the Federation suspect alien beings of interrupting contact and discovering a secret research station on the planet Ipsos III. Your mission, as Agent YG30, is to go to Ipsos III and save the relevant data banks that will protect your people from their space enemies. Receive your Final Command and hold the future of the Federation in your hands!

Final Command is a graphic adventure in a science-fiction setting. The player explores the environment in a first-person perspective, collects items and solves puzzles. The controls are completely mouse based: when it meets an interactive item, its form changes. After clicking once, a selection of commands appears which are also chosen with a click. Up to three save games can be saved on the game disk. The story is told in animated sequences.
