Starflight II: Trade Routes of the Cloud Nebula (SFII), is the sequel to the fantastic Starflight. SFII still has all the exploration, combat, and dialogue that made the first game great. SFII, however, adds one huge element to the game that makes us wonder how we lived without it...trade. This game has you trading with other species for much of the game, and its only through this trade that the game can be won.

You start the game by choosing a custom crew and assigning them to your customized ship. Once your crew is chosen and your ship is named, it's off to the stars with you. Where you go from there is entirely up to you. The game allows for a huge amount of exploration and discovery, and since the game's universe is enormous, this makes for one very long and enjoyable game.

The story of this game is quite different than the first one. The cowardly Spemin (a gelatinous species) has acquired some very sophisticated technology, and are using it to seek revenge on all those who have oppressed (read: made fun) of them in the past. You must find a way to defeat the Spemin through using their game, while saving the universe from a new threat at the same time.

Overall, the game has so much charm, playability, and depth that one can't help but gush about it. If you like science fiction, role playing, adventures, or humor, you're going to love this game. It's got fun in spades, and even if it looks dated, it's fun through and through.
