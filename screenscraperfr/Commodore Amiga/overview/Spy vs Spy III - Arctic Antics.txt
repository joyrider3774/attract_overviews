With characters Taken from MAD Magazine, the Spy Vs. Spy series reached it's end in Arctic Antics. Spy vs Spy: Arctic Antics is an Action/Arcade game, for one or two players, developed by First Star Software and published by Wicked Soft. Released in the UK in 1989 for several contemporary platforms.

The duo, the White Spy (you) and the deadly Black Spy continue their battle. This time, the scrap takes place in the frozen Arctic, the objective: Find the essential components of a brand new rocket before you freeze to death! And more importantly, before your opponent -- the deadly Black Spy -- escapes his own fate or completes the mission instead! Your body temp. is effectively your health. You can get warmer by popping into an Igloo and standing by the fire for a few moments. Remember though! You've only a limited time to complete your mission, so don't dally!

Overall this game is quite fun, if lacking staying power, being the same thing over and over. It's main saving grace is the two-player option. Without it, the game just isn't as funny. I mainly played two-player and then ran through, completing, each difficulty. At higher difficulties it does present a challenge, but I don't think I'll be playing this game as often as others that are similar, due to the repetitive game-play and fiddly controls.
