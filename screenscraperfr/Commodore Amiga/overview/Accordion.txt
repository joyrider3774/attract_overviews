Accordion is a solitaire card game. Cards are dealt face up one at a time and the aim of the game is to condense all cards into a single pile. To build piles, cards are moved from the left to a card or a pile on the right. Piles can be moved one or two cards to the left if the card on the left is of the same suit or if the card on the left is the same number. The game begins with four cards dealt and the player can then choose to make a move or deal another card. If there are no legal moves that can be made from dealt cards, more cards will automatically be dealt.
