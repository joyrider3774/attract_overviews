Super Bob Dylan is a platformer game for the Amiga inspired by the work of Bob Dylan and also the 1985 Nintendo game Super Mario Bros. You control Bob Dylan with the joystick, guiding him through scrolling levels full of deadly enemies, including military tanks, giant bees, aeroplanes, jumping piranhas, and bouncing balls. Some enemies (but not all) can be destroyed by jumping on them. There are two main power-ups: a guitar which makes Dylan's hair bigger, allowing him to break blocks with his head, and a harmonica which allows him to shoot blue musical notes as projectile weapons to defeat his enemies. These power-ups also allow Bob to take an extra hit of damage without dying, as instead he reverts to his original haircut. Vinyl records take the place of Mario's gold coins, where collecting enough of them grants Dylan an extra life.

Levels in Super Bob Dylan are grouped into "records", the equivalent of "worlds" in Super Mario Bros. When you complete all the levels in one record, you are given a password that allows you to start a new game from this point, instead of starting over from the beginning.
