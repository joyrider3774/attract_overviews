1986 saw the release of Jewels of Darkness on the Amiga system, a Text Adventure game with still pictures created by Level 9 and distributed by Firebird in USA and Rainbird in the rest of the world.

Originally conceived in 1983 by Level 9 as the Middle-Earth trilogy, the standalone 8-bit releases of Colossal Adventure, Adventure Quest and Dungeon Adventure were enhanced and published in this renamed compilation Jewels of Darkness.

The Amiga version is the update of the original text-only Middle Earth Trilogy. Jewels of Darkness enhances the original text-only incarnations released for 8-bit platforms by adding graphics, more extensive text descriptions, an extended parser that understands many more commands and other user-friendly features. The subsequent games in this trilogy are full of illogical puzzles and paper-thin plots, although Dungeon Adventure does add a D&D style magic system to make it more interesting. These games originally had references to Lords of the Ring novels that were later removed, possibly to avoid charges of copyright infringement.
