So, at last, the greatest footy team in Britain has lent its name to a game. What a pity it doesn't reflect the quality of the real thing. The game shows a view from just above the pitch, facing one goal area, and the 3-D effect works rather well. The control system is a little lame, though, making it rather difficult to control the ball on the first touch.

The players move about in a rather slippery fashion, which gives the game a Subbuteo feel, and when you do get the ball it's ludicrously easy to score. This is partly due to the fact that you can't see the goal until the ball has been kicked Ã¢â‚¬â€œ making it impossible for the goalie to save it.

Don't get me wrong, this is far from the worst football game on the Amiga. It's got good, fast graphics, and a number of options including two-player and FA Cup. But it has bugs that interfere with the game and when it comes to gameplay, it faces the competition like Kick Off and, unfortunately, it isn't in the same league.
