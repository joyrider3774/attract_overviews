Gadget: Lost in Time is a Platform game, developed by Synergy Inc. and published by ESP Software, which was released in Europe in 1993.

This is a quite simple platformer which starts with a rather steep learning curve. The game is a mix of two genres: an ordinary platformer, combined with a quiz game, asking single-choice questions from the player (three choices in total). Short instructions: Find the crystal and return it back to the time machine. You cannot free the crystal until you have answered ALL questions correctly. H - pause game U - use item (remote control, gun, mirror, monkey-wrench, mask, moonhopper) Pull down the joystick to pick up the bodies of nasties you previously paralyzed by jumping upon. Pressing FIRE will "dispose" them eventually. (NOTE: you must have your hands free to pick up anything, i. e. if you're holding an item, you will have to put it away first)

Later levels are linear, better graphics, quite good and good controls spoiled by inertia.
