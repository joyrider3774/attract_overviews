Faces ...Tris III is a Puzzle game, developed by Sphere, Inc and published by Spectrum Holobyte, which was released in Europe in 1991.

Enough already. Tetris was a killer. Welltris was moderately amusing. Faces is a bore. If it had been the first of the series, I probably would have felt much different about it, but if I want to play a Tetris game, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll play Tetris. This variation drops pairs of pieces of faces (I suppose thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s how they came up with the catchy name) from the top of the screen and you have to maneuver them to fit together. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all slickly done, with good graphics and fun music, but the slickness canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hide the fact that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more marketing than game.
