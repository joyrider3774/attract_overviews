Something that has always amazed me is why golf is such a popular computer conversion. The games do not feature any sequences of nail biting action, and yet on the Commodore 64, Leader Board was the top selling game in 1986. As the Amiga market is following closely in the footsteps of the 64, it is not surprising that three of the first sports conversions are golf games, although they do vary wildly in quality.

Leader Board can only really be described as an arcade golf game. It takes the basic ideas behind golf, simplifies them, and turns the game into one that depends as much on dexterity as it does on tactics.

Once loaded, Leader Board gives you the choice of how many players will take part Ã¢â‚¬â€œ between one and four Ã¢â‚¬â€œ what course you want to play on Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from the four provided Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and what level you want to play at. Provided with the minimalist British packaging, it is a comprehensive guide to both the game and the four courses, and on the Amateur level (where the ball is not affected by book, swing or wing), it is possible for even a total beginner to get round the courses without too many mistakes.

For anyone who has never played golf before, Leader Board provides an excellent introduction. It is one of the most playable sports simulations yet, and even my golf-mad dad found the game simple enough to spend a few quiet hours fiddling with the mouse. In comparison with most games on the Amiga, the graphics are not spectacular, but they are good enough to reflect all the action, and that is the most important. The sound too is uninspiring, but surprisingly the lack of audio-visual stimulation is not seen to detract too much from the game's overall enjoyment level.
