Darkmere - The Nightmare's Begun is an action-adventure game developed by Zero Hour Software and published by Core Design Ltd. in 1993. It is Zero Hour's only title to date. Core Design went on to publish a less-well received pseudo-sequel to Darkmere in 1994 called Dragonstone, on Amiga and Amiga CD32.

Darkmere is an adventure game set in a fantasy universe, with much reference to Tolkien's. You play Ebryn, son of Gildorn. Your father, too old himself to go on such an adventure, sends you to investigate the evil curse that is plaguing your land. The game introduction starts as Ebryn gets teleported in town, and while he slowly materializes, a mighty creepy description sets the atmosphere. Creatures are roaming the abandoned streets, and as the chilly wind bites at you, you can hear the screams of their victims in the distance.
