Captain Blood (L?Arche du Captain Blood in France) is the name of a French video game from 1988 made by ERE Informatique (soon relabeled with their short-lived Exxos label) and released by Infogrames. It was later re-released in the UK by Players Premier Software. The title tune is a stripped down version of "Ethnicolor" by Jean Michel Jarre.

The titular character of the game is a 1980s video game designer, Bob Morlock, who had picked "Captain Blood" as a nickname in tribute to the film starring Errol Flynn of the same name. Morlock develops a new video game about aliens and space travel. While testing for the first time his new project, he becomes warped inside the spaceship of the very game he had designed. Soon after, Blood is forced to go into hyperspace mode and, due to an incident, gets accidentally cloned 30 times. For 800 years, Blood tracks down every clone, as each one took a portion of his vital fluid. When the game begins, Blood successfully disintegrated 25 clones but he needs to kill the last five clones who turned out to be the most difficult to track down or he will lose his last connections with the human species.
