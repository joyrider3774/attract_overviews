Dragon Tiles is a Puzzle game, developed by S.J. Smith and published by CLR Licenceware, which was released in Europe in 1996.

A variant on Shanghai, the ancient Chinese tile game, released when the official Amiga version was long unavailable.

A number of different types of tile are used, with 4 of each. These are arranged in a particular way, with some on top of others and some next to them. The idea is to remove pairs of tiles progressively so as to leave none remaining. However, a tile can only be moved if it has nothing on top of it, and has free space to either the left or right of it.

This version has 18 different tile layouts, and the tiles have modern pictures on them, ranging from Ghostbusters and Batman logos to computer chips and patterns of atoms, which makes the tiles more distinct and colourful, and takes the game out of its old-fashioned context.
