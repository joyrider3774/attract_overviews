4-Get-It is an Puzzle game, developed by Silverfox and published by TTR Development Inc, which was released in Europe in 1992.



This is as vigorously playable as anything I've laid hands on lately. The concept is very straightforward: Manipulate tiles so that matching ones wind up side-by-side (They then vanish). Clear the play-field without stranding any tiles, and move on to the next.



It's a simple little game at heart, but 4-Get-It uses the Amiga's special gifts to their fullest extent.

TTR is on to something wonderful here, and I hope to see more from them.
