This action game is adapted from the Italian comic book Ranx ÃƒÂ  New-York by Stefano Tamburini and Tanino Liberatore. Here the player controls Ranx, a cyborg in a cyberpunk-style world. A lethal virus is spreading, and the President has caught it, so Ranx must go to New York with the antidote to save him. After this, he must rescue his girlfriend in Rome. 

Ranx will fight with ninjas, homosexuals, the Chinese, and others, using his kicks and punches. Items can be picked up including pieces for later repairs and items which can be sold when talking to other characters. Destroy street lamps to get money, but make sure the police don't see.
