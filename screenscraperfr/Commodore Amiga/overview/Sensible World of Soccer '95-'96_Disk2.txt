Greatly enhanced version of "Sensible Soccer". Virtually any important soccer league in the world is included in this game, with some countries not only having premier / first division, but 2nd, 3rd, and more divisions. All important international competitions are also included (club- and national-team based). The game has a career mode, where you may play up to 20 seasons as player manager or manager only. During a career as a coach you're not tied to one club / national team, meaning if you're good enough one (or more) big clubs make offers to you to coach their team. This works both ways. [AFAICanProve] All teams featured in this game have "real" players (names, strengths, weaknesses, etc.) from the ~1995 season. The management part of the game allows you to buy any of these players (which number 24,000 in total) if you have enough money (and a free slot in your team, of course).

Besides the player manger career, one may play friendly matches, single season of any competion, and custom competions (can be made from scratch or based on a real one). Teams participating in these competitions can be chosen from any country. All / Any teams may be played by human or computer.
