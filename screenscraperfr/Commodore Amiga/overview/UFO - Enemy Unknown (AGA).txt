Julian Gollop is a legendary name in certain RPG circles; he wrote many classic 8-bit games, still played by many nostalgia freaks on the multitude of emulators. Bringing his talent to the Amiga, UFO is a huge exploratory romp, seeking out the alien intruder without being squashed - all in a strategic way, based on thought rather than reactions. Long-term entertainment for the more cerebal player.
