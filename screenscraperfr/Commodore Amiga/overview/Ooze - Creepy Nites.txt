In a setting familiar to most horror fans, you must negotiate a variety of creepy events while exploring Carfax Abbey, an ancient dilapidated house that's become your new home. The unusual second-person perspective parser, simplistic but fair puzzles, and good atmosphere makes this a pleasant game that falls short of Infocom's classic horror IF Lurking Horror, but is still a worthy attempt despite banal plot and amateurish writing.
