What can go wrong on a scout summer camp in a dull village? A lake and forest are nearby, as is an old army base, with an old rusty tank making up for a great playground... but now it's your job to rescue a fellow Girl Guide that got trapped inside the tank!

The wacky graphical style and silly jokes were obviously inspired by Day of the Tentacle. The interface is simple and the default action (out of 6 basic commands) is usually highlighted. Just like with other point'n'click adventures from L.K. Avalon, the map allows jumping between locations, saving us tedious walking.
