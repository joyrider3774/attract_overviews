Caribbean Disaster is an Adventure game, developed by Silver Style and published by Ikarion Software GmbH, which was released in Europe in 1996.

Somewhere in the ocean is a little island, inhabited by a President and three ministers (of the air force, navy, and army). The island also has ten other resident citizens. Every morning the President receives money from the American and Russian embassies, which can be given to the ministers or spent to improve the PresidentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s residence in the Arctic.

When two of the three ministers vote against the President, there is a vote of non-confidence and an election happens. Now the player has to convince the population of their leadership abilities, using the unique skills of special contacts: the chief of the Secret Police, for example, arrests political enemies (the ministers), the radio disc jockey spreads false news and the priest sells weapons.

Three types of weapons also enter into these negotiations Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tanks, zeppelins and submarines, one fitting each of the Defense ministries. After every round the player can attack their political enemies in a very military fashion.
