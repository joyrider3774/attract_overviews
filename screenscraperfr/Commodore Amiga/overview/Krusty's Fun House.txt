Ask any Simpsons fan and they will tell you itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just Bart, Lisa, Homer, Marge and Maggie that make the show worth going to a BSkyB-owning friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house to watch. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the subsidiary characters too: people like Itchy Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Scratchy, and Krusty the clown. KrustyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Super Fun House is a good-looking, nicely thought-out platform game which should be able to keep the most jaded of gamers on their toes for a while.

You move Krusty about a few platforms, each of which contains a number of doors. Simply stand outside a door, soak in the strangely menacing music, press the fire-button and in you go to one of the sub-levels. Then all you have to do is to play a kind of reverse Troddlers/Lemmings in which you have to lead a bunch of rats to their deaths at the hands of a major Simpsons character. Like Troddlers you have to make use of blocks to achieve this aim. Unlike Troddlers you have to search for these blocks along your way - and this search becomes more difficult with the later levels.

The game looks excellent, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s some great use of colour and neatly designed levels, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s let down by strange parallax scrolling and poor collision detection. Despite the moans KrustyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Super Fun House is a mightily enjoyable piece of Amiga gameplay. Once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got over the initial amazement that Krusty himself can outleap Bob Fosbury from a standing start, you will find yourself coming back for more and more.
