The Psygnosis team has come a long way since their first Amiga title (the underwhelming Brataccas); Deep Space is my favorite of the new crop. The whole package is a treat, from the delightfully raunchy comic-book in the box to the ultra techno-funky controls and the humorous enemy spacecraft that look like hi-thrust box Kites. You play the part of Strix, the owl-headed galactic sociopath bounty hunter, scouring the galaxy causing, as much mayhem as possible (especially for Mirfaks) and making your fortune any way you can. First-rate, in itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time.
