Matrix is a basic puzzle game. Two players, the second either controlled by a human or the AI, are presented with a playfield which consists of 64 fields. Each player has an own stone colour and puts one of them on the playfield during each turn. A stone has to be entered from the side of the playfield which causes the whole line to be pushed by one field. A row consisting of four stones of one colour is transformed into generic wall stones and the player receives ten points. After 64 moves (32 for each player), the participant with the most points wins. The game features a few additional options like a time limit for each move, special fields like holes or jokers and pre-defined boards.
