Embryo is a Shooter game, developed by Beyond Arts and published by Black Legend, which was released in 1994.

Embryo is a 3D shooter by a Croatian development team, with an excellent 3D engine! The 3D world is not very detailed but very fast giving a true sense of speed, with some nice effects like bullets hitting the ground. The 2D graphics, still images and especially the original cockpit design, are also outstanding.

I have two problems with Embryo, though. One, as has also been noted in many contemporary magazine reviews, is that it takes forever to bring even a single enemy down. The enemy helicopter, gun turrets etc simply take way too many hits before being destroyed. Two, the gameplay is too simple even for a 3D shooter. All you can do is fly around and kill enemies, in very simple missions. Earlier games like Starglider II or Interphase have shown how far you can take the gameplay for this kind of game, but the much later Embryo has gameplay that feels straight out of the early 80s.

Still, there's a lot to like about Embryo and if you like fast 3D on a standard Amiga with plenty of hard action, this one is worth to check out.
