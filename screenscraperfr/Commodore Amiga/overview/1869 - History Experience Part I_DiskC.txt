1869 is a strategy and economics trading game developed by the Austrian company Max Design GesMBH and published by Flare Software for Amiga OCS/ECS/AGA series of computers in 1993.

You cannot beat the feeling of power money brings, and there is plenty of money to be made in the A1200 version of 1869. It is the late 19th Century and the world is wracked with civil wars and international conflicts. In many ways, there has never been a more exciting time to launch a business venture.

You play the owner of a fledgling shipping company and you have to use your skills as a tactician and businessman to exploit the various trading situations around the world. If you succeed then your business expands, but if you fail, you could end up losing more than just your livelihood.

The A1200 version of this game does not actually seem to be that much different from the original version â€“ you get the same brief animation sequences and humorous interludes. You even listen to the same irritatingly nautical chip music. However, 1869 can be best appreciated in multi-player mode with you and up to three other pals battling it out for the ultimate control of the high seas.

If you're heavily into 19th century nautical history, or play on an Amiga with other enlightened beings, and the idea of pretending to be a hard-nosed, back-stabbing, scrupulous capitalist appeals to you, then go buy this game. Just be prepared to play like a real Thatcherite.
