What happened so far... Strangers from the planet Dumcleps sent some ships to attack planet Enacirruh. They destroyed the cities and killed civilians without any reason. Their aim was to occupy the planet. The United Galaxy Forces charged you to rescue the planet and to defeat the evil. There is not much time until the whole planet is ruined. Try your best!
