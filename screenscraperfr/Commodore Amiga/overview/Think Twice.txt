Think Twice is a conversion of the board game Mastermind. The basic concept is unchanged: there are four free slots and six colours. In each round the computer randomly generates a colour combination and the player has to guess it within ten turns. In each round, the player divides the colours in the slots and the computer tells how many colours were correct of how many of them are in the correct slots. There are four playing modes: each colour only appears once per round, colours can appear multiple times, "no colour" is a seventh possibility and a combination of the two latter.
