1988 saw the release of Action game called OsWALD of the Ice Floes on the Amiga systems, created by Silverrock and published by Silverrock (DK) and Centaur (US).

The game was designed by Ivan SÃƒÂ¸lvason for use as a game controlled over a push-button telephone, for Danish TV2's Friday night prime time program Eleva2ren. The game sold well in Denmark due to the exposure in Eleva2ren.

Your goal is to reach to the end of the level jumping form one iceberg to another and avoiding nasties who try to stop  you.
