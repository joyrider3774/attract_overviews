Supremacy: Your Will Be Done, released as Overlord in the US, is a strategy video game designed by David Perry & Nick Bruty and produced by Probe Software.

The goal of Supremacy is to create and protect a network of planetary colonies and defeat a computer adversary who is trying to do the same. There are four skill levels, each represented by an enemy race, and each featuring a progressively stronger opponent. The more advanced a system is, the more freedom a player has when purchasing spacecraft. Higher skill levels also result in different numbers of planets in each system.

The game was initially released for the Amiga and Atari ST computers in the beginning of 1990.
