Myth is a mini-adventure with about thirty locations, but because it was programmed with Magnetic Scrolls' usual adventure system, there is room for masses of text Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and that is what you will find in it. There are very few 'scenery' objects, and the messages are full and plentiful.

Set in the days of Greek mythology, you play the part of Poseidon, god of the sea. Zeus is having a temple-warming party, when he decides that gods have too easy a life Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and so he announces it is his intention to strip them of their godly powers, until such time as they succeed in a task, normally befitting a moral hero.

And it is just your luck he picks on you first Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to enter Hades and steal the fabled helmet of invisibility. Embarrassing, too, for the god of the sea, who cannot swim, and comes across deep waters early on in the game!

Do not be put off by it being a mini-adventure Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it is about the same size as a 'full size' text adventure. You get four pictures up to usual Scrolls standard, plus text undreamed of in those bygone days!
