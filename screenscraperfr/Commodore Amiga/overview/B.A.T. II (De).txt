This second part of the BAT series takes place in ROMA 2, the most important city of the planet Shedishan. The United Galaxies Organization has contacted the "Bureau of Astral Troubleshooters (BAT) in order to investigate the murder of a BAT agent named Sylvia Hatford who tried to uncover the businesses of a mysterious dealer of important raw materials. You are playing the second agent, Jehan Menais, now involved in the dangerous investigations.

The game itself is a mixture between graphics adventure, space combat simulator and strategy game. The adventure part is realized in a classic 2D point-and-click environment, the space combat can be best described as a small version of Firebird's Elite, and the various small arcade games included can either be played in a strategic mode or an arcade mode where your reaction skills are required.
