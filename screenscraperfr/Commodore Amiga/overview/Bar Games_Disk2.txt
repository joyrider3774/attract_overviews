This game consists of a compilation of Ã¢â‚¬ËœBar GamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. The games include, LiarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dice, Wet & Wild, Air Hockey, Pick Up Artist, and Last Call. This game is not for children as there is some sexual content and nudity to some of the games.

 LiarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dice is a game where you bet on how many of a certain number you roll on a dice. Last Call is a game where you have to serve beers to your customers. Air Hockey has you playing this game against a computer opponent. Wet and Wild has you trying to pour water over girls who walk across the screen. Pick Up Artist has you trying to pick up 1 of 3 girls in a bar.

In conclusion, I thought this was an interesting game. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a novel idea and is executed pretty well. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s definitely made for a male game player and adults at that. The graphics are decent and the girls in the game are very pretty. I tried using the pickup lines that worked in this game in a real bar and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sorry to say that they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work as well in real life. Oh well, maybe next time. If you want to play a game where you pour water over girls and then enjoy a game of air hockey, then get this game. I liked this game, as I say, I thought it was a novel idea and the games do actually play well. An essential purchase? No, not really, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m glad its in my software collection.
