The gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor, Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?. The goal of the game is to track Carmen's henchmen across the United States, arrest them, and ultimately arrest Carmen Sandiego, who has escaped from a European prison and has gone to the US to assemble a gang of V.I.L.E. members to steal the country's treasures.

The player, an agent of ACME Detective Agency, must gather information on the suspect and use it to obtain a warrant to reduce the potential suspects to one of the V.I.L.E. members in the database. The player must then track the criminal to the final destination and make an arrest. The player advances in rank throughout the game, eventually reaching the level of Super Sleuth. The player captures 16 of Carmen's crooks before having a chance to arrest her.

The main screen interface is divided into four sections showing the day, time, and location; textual information, an image from the current city, and the available actions. The game was supplied with a special copy of Fodor's USA encyclopedia as a reference guide and a travel guide book.  The deluxe version of the game includes more than 50 digitized photographs, numerous state topographical maps, digitized sounds, and music.
