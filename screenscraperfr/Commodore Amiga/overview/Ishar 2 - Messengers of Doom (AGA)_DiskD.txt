The sequel to Ã¢â‚¬ËœIshar: Legend Of the FortressÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ takes up the story long after the destruction of Krogh, by Aramir and his companions - including KroghÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own mother, the witch Morgula! The former Fortress of Ishar became the new growth epicentre for the Aborean archipelago - The Isle of Kendoria and diverse islands named after JarelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s companions where another evil lord arose - Shandar. Zubaran, IsharÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s current Ruler,  hears of this. So, naturally, Shandar must be found and destroyed. This is the ultimate object of the game.

The SilmarilsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ standard of graphics and gameplay is sustained, and in parts improved upon, in this evolved creation of a larger and more involved fantasy world. Additions to this game include the introduction of topography. There is a greater variety of characters and creatures and everything is, again, nicely drawn, but the animation remains Ã¢â‚¬ËœstaticÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.

You start out alone, broke etc., but you have the option of using your team from Ã¢â‚¬ËœIshar 1Ã¢â‚¬â„¢. There is a map in this game which, unlike its predecessor, actually shows your position, plus indications of places to go/avoid. This sequel does rely more heavily on precursive tasks, and, unfortunately in this way, does tend towards the linear - but, not in an obvious, precognitive, or boring, way.

Overall? Quite a romp! Escapist adventure, or what?! Less uneventful/aimless wandering than either predecessor, but you need an eagle-eye to pick up on some things, even from the start. Difficulty level?  Not novice, you need a bit of experience.  Not as dull/predictable/frustrating/unimaginative as one or two other RPGs I could mention. Have fun!
