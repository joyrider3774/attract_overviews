This is some sort of Choplifter clone minus clear goal what to do. There are no people to pick up and since you can not shoot,  you have to dodge observation balloons while receiving fire from the ground. After you pass balloons, and spend some time of progressing horizontally to the right, scrolling will stop and you can only go back, just to be shot down by barrage of rockets from a jeep. Graphics are okay for 1989, sound is expected, controls are suspicious and replayability is... There is none. Oh, yea, loading times are horrible and you have to wait through credits to start the game, and there is a lot of credits. All I can say is play something else.
