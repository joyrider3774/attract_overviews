Crown is a jump and run game. The goal is to travel trough six different countries to finally become king. The game is non-linear, so the player can choose which country he wants to go to. The levels are pretty different: in England, you need to control a knight on his horse. You need to jump over all hurdles and collect all 80 shields to complete the level. In Scandinavia, you control a Viking on his boat. Here you need to collect treasure chests and avoid the whales crossing your way. In Russia, you play a Russian bear who needs to imitate the dance of a girl next to him. If he succeeds, the bystanders will give him money. In Japan, you control a small dragon which needs to jump from island to island. On his way, he needs to collect 80% of the stuff floating around or he will starve to death. In India, the small Indian boy needs to walk over the bridge, avoiding the flying bananas (?) and catch 8 mice. And finally, in Arabia, you control a dude on a flying carpet who needs to catch at least 50% of the flying lamps to stay on his carpet.
