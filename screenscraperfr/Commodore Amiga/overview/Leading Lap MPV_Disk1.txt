Hailed as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Formula One Grand Prix beaterÃ¢â‚¬Â by new kids on the block, Kellton,  Leading Lap very nearly give the claim validity. But not quite.

Before we discuss why, let's look at what makes Leading Lap a creditable pretender to the crown. It's got a tremendous multiview 3D polygon based engine driving it and the frame rate is fast enough to ensure a smooth, believable motor racing environment. It makes use of extra memory, faster processors and FPUs with the handling of the various cars is such that if you drive too fast on a long bend the car spins out due to excessive speed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ incredibly realistic for a game which is more arcade based than simulation. Finally, the driving has a reasonably good feel to it (or a hybrid between an arcade game and a simulation)

And then there's the but. An unfortunate but, but a 'but' nevertheless. There aren't enough competitors taking part in the race - four in all. To maintain a credible sense of conflict throughout a full race, there should always be someone to press for a place, or someone pressing for a place on you. That doesn't happen with Leading Lap. Still, it's fun in a limited kind of a way to reach the giddy heights of being the winner all the time. With twelve tracks to race on it's going to take you a reasonable stretch of extended play before approaching anything like full competency.

In all, a competent, enjoyable romp. Not quite up with F1 for immediacy and out and out pace, but still good enough to convince enough people to part with their cash for a few hours of solid entertainment. If you've got an Amiga friend, try out the serial link option; it's not bad.
