As Hiro, you must once again defeat the ninja lord Havok. Using ninja throwing stars and other weapons, you must defeat the minions of Havok to reach him.

Switchblade II is a side-scrolling platform action game. One key aspect of the game is obtaining coins from defeated enemies, which can be traded at shops for extra lives, energy, and weapons.

A sequel to Switchblade, Switchblade II is an action-platformer. The action is viewed from the side. The player guides the protagonist, Hiro, through six levels infested with mechanoid, metal-clad enemies. Weapons include a knife, homing missiles, a laser beam, a flame thrower and shuriken.

Although the game was developed in the UK, its graphics had a distinctly Japanese style, similar to manga.
