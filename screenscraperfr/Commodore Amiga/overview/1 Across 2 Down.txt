If you like crosswords, this one is really good. The game engine does not have any serious flaws but questionable is function to solve the crossword. All the fun is lost when you solve it and then do it on your own. For me it lacks some challenge mechanism, eg. Elapsed time of solving the crossword, high score table of the fastest solvers. Editor of creating your own crosswords also would be nice an add-on. Still, very good game (if you like such things).
