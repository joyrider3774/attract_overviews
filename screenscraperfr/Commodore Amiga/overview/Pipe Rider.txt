Fairly standard space shooter with the slight twist of having you control two ships that ride along a pipe at the edges of the screen in some levels. The game features a title theme with typical soundtracker library samples and what sounds like an unlicenced sample from some synth pop band between levels. I am a bit surprised this is supposed to be a commercial game because it merely meets the technical proficiency of readily available shareware and freeware titles of the mid-nineties.
