Gamma Zone is a Maze/Puzzle game, developed and published by Limes Alpha Codeworks, which was released in Europe in 1993.

What a great little game! Very like Chip's Challenge with nice graphics and a much needed password system. The level design and graphic effects are awesome. You should definitely check this one out!
