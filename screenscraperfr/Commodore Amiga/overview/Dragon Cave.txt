Ã¢â‚¬ËœEre, these PD puzzlers are blimminÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ good, arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t they? Dragon Cave is a mega-marvelous maze-based monster maul and for once it actually has a plot!

Smaug the dragon has a problem. He needs (for reasons unspecified) to push his treasure chests into certain places within his caverns. Trouble is heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too big to wend his weary way through the maze of corridors that is his domain - why heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hiding his treasure in places he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even get into isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t specified, but muggins (thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s you) has volunteered to help.

Set over umpteen single-screen levels, you must push the chests into the positions indicated. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t push more than one chest or pull them at all, so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very easy to slam one into a corner, making it irretrievable. Luckily thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an Ã¢â‚¬ËœundoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ option for just this situation.

You get a choice of 2D or 3D perspectives - the latter looks far better but is all-but-useless when  playing the game. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a level editor too, so in the unlikely event of you completing the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s many levels, you can swap a few with your friends. There are no passwords, but you can pick your starting level.

The heart of a game like Dragon Cave is its layout, and this one certainly isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t found lacking. An absolute rip-snorter and a bargain at PD prices - buy it!
