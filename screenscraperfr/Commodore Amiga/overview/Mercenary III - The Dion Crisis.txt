In this third part of the Mercenary series you have to enlarge your previous success by getting as much money as you can within 24 hours. To do this you visit the locations of that solar system with either some public transport, or you also can find your old star glider. There is also a teleportation system, which speeds things up. Initially you are struck by the size of the accessible area, but eventually you explore the area and you find single tasks, the completion of which
brings you money.

The buildings are nicely constructed, although a bit distant from each other, so there are large areas of nothing, but on the other hand you don't need to walk between them. Unlike in other adventures there's not only one way to complete the game, so your chances of solving it is increased significantly. The graphics are reasonably fast on a powerful Amiga, so it's really fun to play it if you get into it. The position of your game can be saved every time on one of the 10 slots.

As far as gameplay goes though, it's a winner. Perhaps a bit too slow moving for hard-bitten arcade fans, but for those who like to ponder over problems rather than leaping in feet first all guns blazing, it's the closest you're going to get to virtual reality on your Amiga. And it's a damn sight more interesting as well. A large, bulging sack of gorgeousness.
