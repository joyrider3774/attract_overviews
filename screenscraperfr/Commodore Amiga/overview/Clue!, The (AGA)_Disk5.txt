You play Matt Stuvysant, a man of Polish descent and criminal persuasion.
You arrive in London with nothing but the clothes on your back and a desire to become the greatest criminal mind this century.
  Once getting a room and meeting some accomplices, you must begin your career. Starting with small shops and gradually working your way up to the theft of the Crown Jewels.

  The game allows you to control almost every aspect of the crime, from choosing the target building and accomplices to actually planning the burglary itself.
