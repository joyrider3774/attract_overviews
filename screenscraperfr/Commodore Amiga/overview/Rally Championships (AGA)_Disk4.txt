A fine AGA racing game from the Flair UK. It features realistic car physics and driving, a car range: Porsche RS, Peugot 205 Rally, Opel Calibra, Lancia Delta, Ford Escort Turbo, and the Toyota Celica. Rally courses range from snowy Scandinavia to the dusty East African savanna, bustling city streets of France, lush tropical rainforests, and even very narrow passes on the Alps.
