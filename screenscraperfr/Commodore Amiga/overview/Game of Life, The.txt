The Game of Life is a Strategy game, developed and published by Linel, which was released in Europe in 1992.

Calling itself modestly "the ultimate cell simulation", the Game of Life tries to recreate the processes inside a simple organic structure. This body consists of five different types of cells: The proto cells (the "flesh") will grow quickly and aimless, unless you border them with skin. To control proto growth, you can install control cells; they consume energy produced by support cells. Sense cells will provide you with information about the well-being of your organic entity.

The basic cells will grow all by themselves, but also rot if left unattended. Your task is control: Move or destroy unwanted cell blocks, build and link a power supply throughout the structure, prevent decay and (in later missions) virus attacks. There are 99 levels to fulfill. Early ones make you rebuild a given design; later on, you'll have to reach goals like a certain amount of energy stockpiled. The time for each mission is limited.
