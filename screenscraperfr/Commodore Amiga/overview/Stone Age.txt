Stone Age is a challenging puzzle game where you are in control of a dinosaur and you have to make him reach the exit of each cave. The dinosaur can only walk on certain blocks on the level: some are just ordinary blocks, some are movable in the direction the arrow points, some crumble after you walk on them, and some have coloured keys which are needed to get past locks of the same colour.
