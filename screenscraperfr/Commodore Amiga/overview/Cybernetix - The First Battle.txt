Cybernetix: The First Battle is a Shoot 'Em Up game, developed by Vision and published by Amiga Format, which was released in Europe in 1992.



It can happen! And it has! Finally, a PD game - all right, shareware, but still darned cheap - that l can wholeheartedly say is better than a lot of the commercial stuff that's available. New Zealand-written slice of freely distributable software. My life has meaning once more!



So, why is Cybernetix so good? Well, it certainly isn't originality. It s basically Defender meets Asteroids on steroids. A sideways-scrolling blast-'em-up where you have to obliterate everything in each section which comes complete with a variety of power-ups, bonus lives every 10.000 points and a smart bomb. But there are three main reasons why it shines. It looks stunning, it plays like a dream and it's fast. Faster, in fact, than a very fast thing.



The graphics are pure quality. The asteroids really look 3D while the substantial-looking ships explode into shrapnel, and some even start spouting smoke and spiraling out of control when they are first hit and need to be hit again. The controls are very responsive, which they need to be at the speeds this game reaches. The radar is also very clear and you need to keep one eye on it to see where the alien ships are when they're off the main screen.



There are tons of sectors to clear, some with special missions, and a two-player option. Oh yes, and the sound is also superb.



VERDICT: The concept might not be all that original, but the game has so much style, action and playability, who cares? Do yourself a favour, and get It now and remind yourself what good old blasting is all about.
