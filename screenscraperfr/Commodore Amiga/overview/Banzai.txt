It's a fairly interesting Commando-like shoot'em-up game that looks and feels very much like an 8-bit game. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, because I was referring to those good and enjoyable games that populated the C64 and Spectrum (Commando, Ikari Warriors, etc), the MSX (Knightmare, Hinotori, etc) or the NES (Ai Senshi Nicol, Gaiapolis, etc), so Banzai is refreshingly simple and playable. Having the chance of playing the japanese in a seemingly WW2 themed game is a rare treat (of this guise, I only recall Front Line on the NES). Having said that, though, the game could have used some better graphics...
