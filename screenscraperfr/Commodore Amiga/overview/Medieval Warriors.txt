Originating from amid the oil wells of Texas, Medieval Warriors has seeped into the English market. American products tend to be of a very high quality, so great interest surrounded the game.

You must battle with opposing armies over a number of different scenarios. With a limited number of armies under your control, you must decide upon a plan of action and march forward, hopefully, to a glorious victory.

Bowmen can attack from quite a distance while sword-wielding soldiers must enter into close combat. With up to eight types of weapons available, battle results will depend on how well your men are equipped.

Decisions regarding the deployment of your armies are of great importance, especially when there are castles to storm, villages to overrun and open-field conflicts.

Thankfully, there is a Save Game option, plus the opportunity to indulge in the current craze; connect up two Amigas via a null modem cable.
