The Secret of Monkey Island (Demo Version) is a demo version for The Secret of Monkey Island. Guybrush Threepwood finds himself in the harbor town of Melee Island but is trapped from leaving it: a troll blocks the exit and won't let Guybrush pass until he knows the magic phrase.

To solve the game the player has to explore the (shortened) town and solve a few basic puzzles which are partly not present in the full version of the game. He also needs to chat with several persons known from the game which all have new dialogue, e.g. the voodoo lady talks about some features of the commercial version and Guybrush constantly cracks jokes about this being a demo.

The game uses the same control scheme as the most Lucasfilm adventures at the time. On the bottom of the screen are nine verbs displayed. The player clicks on of these verbs and then on an item in the game world to issue a command, e.g. picking something up.
