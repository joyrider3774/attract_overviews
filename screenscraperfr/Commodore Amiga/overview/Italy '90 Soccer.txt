Another football game, yet again based upon the 1990 World Cup. At least Simulmondo are an Italian software house, which canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be bad considering itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the host nation. Simulmondo have looked into their (cracked) crystal ball, and found only eight competing teams. Matches are between six and ten minutes long and are viewed as if watching from the stands.

Sprites are very small (although their boots are comparitively huge) and badly animated Ã¢â‚¬â€ they look like theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re doing the can-can. Effects are few and are the usual screeches.

ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult to know what to say here. The pathetic graphics are overwhelmingly off-putting, and when you force yourself to play, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just as slow and dull as expected. Italy Soccer Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ90 is as old-fashioned in itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gameplay as it is in itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s graphics. Avoid at all costs.
