This is a quiz designed to teach children the relationships between days of the week, between months, seasons and events of the year. It starts by teaching the basics behind the subject matter and then moves on to a series of tests, including sequence and spelling tests. Calendar Quiz is not the most visually interesting educational title available, but it covers the subject matter well enough. I am not totally convinced that it would keep a child's interest for long, so parental involvement is definitely needed to stop the little 'un rebooting the Amiga with a copy of Super Space Invaders in the drive.
