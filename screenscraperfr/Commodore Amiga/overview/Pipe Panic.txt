1991 saw the release of a Puzzle game called Pipe Panic on the Amiga systems, created by Cranium and published by Amigo! for free as a Public Domain.

Another pipe puzzler where player has to construct pipeline connecting it with... something. Not so random pipe pieces will appear, but nothing what you actually need. All in all, gameplay is dull, graphics are forgettable but musics are very well done.

Game is utter rubbish and there is no justification for this nonsense. Go to lengths to avoid it, please.
