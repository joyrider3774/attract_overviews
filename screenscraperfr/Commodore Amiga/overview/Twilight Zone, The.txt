This is a text/graphic adventure adaption of Rod Serling's classic television show, boasting a twist ending on par with some of the best episodes.

Twilight Zone is a good game in the same vein as Mike Berlyn's Altered Destiny: a hapless hero gets sucked into an alien world where he must find a way back home and saves that world in the process. Good puzzles, reasonably intelligent parser, and engaging plot make this an underrated game. An all-text mode is also available for IF purists.
