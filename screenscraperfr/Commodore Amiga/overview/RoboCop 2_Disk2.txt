The Amiga version of RoboCop 2 is very similar to other versions of the game released by Ocean Software: it combines platform levels with a puzzle mode and a first-person shooting gallery. While the puzzle and shooting modes are very similar to those on the Atari ST, the main platform sections feature completely different level designs and separate gameplay mechanics.

All three of the platform stages present RoboCop with a set goal: destroying the Nuke drug lab, apprehending the criminal Cain and finally destroying Cain in his "RoboCop 2" form. On the way to the goals, RoboCop must defeat swarms of henchmen who attack him with guns, mortars and bazookas, and in the last level, various robotic enemies like flying drones and ED-209s. He can shoot back with a standard gun as well as pick up weapon power-ups in the form of cola cans: three-way shot, scatter shot and rapid fire, each with limited but ample ammunition. Other cans enhance the time limit of the level, replenish life energy or provide a temporary shield. Not every power-up should be picked up, however: some have negative effects like reducing the time limit or reversing the controls.
