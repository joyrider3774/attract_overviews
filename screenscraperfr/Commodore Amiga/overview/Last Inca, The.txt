Traditional adventures are something of a rarity these days as most companies have diversified into either role-playing games or animated cartoon style stories. The Last Inca comes from a company new to me. Free Spirit Software who have licensed it from an American company Axxiom.

The story goes like this: there was once an evil wizard, called Zulphosi, who was captured by three wizards living in the Galapagos Islands. His imprisonment lasted for many years but, eventually, after the last of the three wizards died, he managed to bribe the guards and buy his freedom.

Now, he seeks revenge on your people, the Incas. for the sole reason that you were strong allies of the wizards. In order to wreak his vengeance, he needs to find the Crown of Power. The only way to stop him is to find it before he does. And it is up to you, as the Inca warrior chosen, to meet the challenge.

On your quest you will need to overcome a voracious condor, explore an underground complex, deal with medicine men, trolls, and discover why a little old man is sitting on top of a monolith. There are the usual locked doors that will need to be opened, and you will also come across traces of ancient civilisations and fabled gems.

The Last Inca is a perfect example of everything that an adventure shouldn't be! Leaving aside the rather hackneyed story line, and the relatively small size of the game (only sixty odd locations), we come to the major problems. The parser is quite simply unacceptable these days. The location descriptions are brief, and none too helpful. They are also littered with spelling and grammatical errors. Also, there is an annoying tune which adds nothing to the game, although it can be toggled off. The graphics are poor as well. I am really at a loss to know why this game was ever released.
