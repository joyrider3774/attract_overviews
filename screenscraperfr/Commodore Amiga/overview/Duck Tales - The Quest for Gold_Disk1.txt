This game follows the adventures of Scrooge McDuck and his three nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie.nnnnThe aim of the game is shown in the introduction. Flintheart Glomgold challenges Scrooge to a competition to see who the richest duck in the world is. They each have 30 days to see who can get the most money together and finally their dispute will be settled.nnnnScrooge's office is your headquarters.
