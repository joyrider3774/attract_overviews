The premise of the Zelda style game is that a hero with a mission (rescue princess, free lands, destroy evil - that sort of thing) sets off on a voyage of discovery through different 'lands' or 'zones'. Picking up weapons along the way it ends up being a cross between a Commando style game and an adventure. Yes, you have to shoot or beat things roundly about the head with swords and like, but you also have to collect an inventory, talk to people and solve puzzles. Legends fits all of the above criteria. Give someone an object for a favour? Yes. this game is all about trading too.

Life is a precious thing in Legends. You have a certain number of continues, but there is no facility to save a game in the middle of a level, which is frustrating. One of Legends' great advantages is that you have four worlds to explore: North American, Egypt, Mediaeval, China and an additional Space Ship level. This provides major variety in terms of gameplay but it also means that once you're used to the enemies in one world everything changes in the next one and you start getting killed too easily.

Another annoying point about Legends is that the weapons are a bit weedy and the enemies are too persistent at times. This means that you can spend far too long high-tailing it out of situations without having enough chance to stand and fight, which I always find most enjoyable.

This is a step above Speris, and those who have boon searching for Zelda on an A1200 or A4000 need look no further. With various sub games, mazes and the like there is a lot of gameplay in here, and even though the various attempts at humour seem to fall flat (on me at least) it's still a fun adventure.
