The action is viewed from side-on and overhead, giving a slight forced perspective. Control is precise and the ball sticks to your feet to some extent. The only teams included are the eight qualifiers for the 1992 European Championships, and that is the only tournament. You can play either as the nearest player to the ball, or always be Barnes.
