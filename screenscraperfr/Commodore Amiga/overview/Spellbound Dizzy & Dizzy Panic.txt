Spellbound Dizzy is by far the best escapade the little egg has had. With colourful graphics and the usual Dizzy gameplay.

It's not really worth relating the plot, suffice it to say that our Diz has to save the Yolkfolk from the standard terrible fate. Along the way he has to collect and manipulate various objects, while communicating with certain other characters.

It doesn't push the Amiga to its limits, and neither is it astounding in terms of
originality, but the unique charm of CodeMasters' cartoon hero is undeniable. Perhaps the game's only flaw is that there's a little too much wandering back and forth.

It's not a classic by any means, but you'd be as mad as a March Hare if you haven't at least looked at it yet.
