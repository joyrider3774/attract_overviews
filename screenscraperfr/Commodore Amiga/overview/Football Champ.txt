Remember I Play 3D Soccer? Well, in their almost obsessive quest to make the ultimate 3D soccer game, Simulmondo have gone a step further. Now, instead of just viewing the pitch from one angle, you rotate the whole world around your player.

The effect is impressive as vectors and sprites are scaled and stretched to create a convincing pitch environment. Unfortunately, the game is practically unplayable: it's almost impossible to keep track of what's going on and you can't instantly swap control from one player to another. This leads to an overwhelming feeling of disorientation. There's a comprehensive tactical and team management aspect to the game, but when it plays as badly as this, who cares?
