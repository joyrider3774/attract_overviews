You're an explorer. If you choose to play a single game, you may play against the computer or simply for your enjoyment. There are different difficulty levels to choose from, but they don't really change the gameplay. They just make the odds against you (like the weather and stuff).

The object of the game is to find the lost objects, that are hidden throughout the world and bring them to the base (it says where to bring them). When you do, you'll get additional plane tickets (you can't go anywhere without those) and new objects to look for. The number of objects is limited, so you can win by finding them all, otherwise the game ends when all players run out of tickets. At that point the score is awarded and the player with the highest score is the champion. But why would anybody hide objects throughout the world? It seems it's a contest, because in the end, they'll applaud the best treasure hunter. So they deliberately hid those treasures.

That's about it. I suggest you play the game and test your knowledge of different countries and typical objects for those countries. It can be fun, even if you play alone (against the computer), but it's always better to invite friends.
