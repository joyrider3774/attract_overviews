The game, surprisingly enough, is a horizontally scrolling beatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢em-up affair. Not very innovative I know, yet itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a tried and tested theme that proves very popular with younger people. Personally, I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t touch the coin-op, or any other tedious beatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢em-up for that matter, with a barge pole.

The game begins from a small selection screen. That is, either one or two players can choose which particular Turtle character theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d most like to take control of.  A short and tacky intro sequence follows and then the fun really begins. The main aim of the game is to rescue April OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Neil, a top TV news reporter in New York. It just so happens that the evil Foot Clan who kidnapped her in the original game, have repeated this outrageous crime. Our heroes must battle their way through hoards of adversaries using their weapon and of course, a number of bread and butter Turtle actions. Each move is joystick controlled. As the levels progress, the baddies begin to carry weapons and throw lethal objects in the general direction of the Turtles.

This game consists of little more than moving your character into position and endlessly pressing the fire button. In conversion terms this is also very poor. The graphics bear little resemblance to their crisply defined arcade counterparts, and the sound is simply awful when compared to the likes of First Samurai.
