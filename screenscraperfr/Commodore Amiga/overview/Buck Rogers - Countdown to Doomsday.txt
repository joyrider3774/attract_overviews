The RAM (Russo-American Mercantile) organisation is based on Mars. They want to control the Solar System - a natural enough ambition, I suppose. They rule Earth with an iron hand, thus NEO (New Earth Organization) has been formed to counter the tyranny. After Buck Rogers was found and revived from his frozen snooze he joined NEO and helped to remove RAM troops from Earth. However, fear of RAM is still high as they could strike any at time. You join the NEO, one of many new recruits. Buck's task is to form a team, get the hell out into space and put the stellar wind up the dreaded RAM.

Buck Rogers uses an uprated AD&D system although there are many similarities. The swords have been replaced by laser guns, the towns and villages by planets and space stations. You still control a group of six, the menu interface is structured in the same way, even the 'meanwhile' screens appear to have the same artistic 'feel' to them. However, there are many improvements. The complex skill system being the most important.

There is no doubt that Buck Rogers sits firmly as the king of the 'Tactical' RPG castle.
