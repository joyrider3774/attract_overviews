Bograts, The Puzzling Misadventure is a Puzzle game, developed and published by Vulcan Software, which was released in Europe in 1996.

"It isn't easy being a parent, as any Bograt will tell you", begins the blurb for Bograts, Vulcan Software's latest MiniSeries game.

Anyway, easy or not, you're a Bograt, and you've been left in charge of your two offspring (affectionately known as "Red" and "Blue") for an evening. Right on cue, they go off and decide it's time to go hunting for the magical eggs at the big bad Mystical Castle of Bog. Right, that's the plot out of the way. Yes, it's another save'em'up - get dumb creatures from A to B without being killed along the way.

The first real criticism is that the graphics just aren't clear enough and what really annoyed me, however, was the restart level facility - or the lack of it. You cannot start a level again from scratch - you either start from the very beginning of level 1 again, or you load a saved game.

Pros: Level designs show thought, and the puzzle fan will enjoy working through of the 60 stages - plenty to be going on with. Cons: Confusing graphics, and poor restart facilities. Not for those without a brain.
