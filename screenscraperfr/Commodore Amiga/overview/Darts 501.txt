"How can vou computerise darts?" I hear you ask. Well, the idea is that you use the mouse to aim roughly where you want to throw your darts, with the computer randomly wobbling your sight around a bit. This works surprisingly well. While computerised darts isn't quite the same as throwing a few arrers at the oche in the local after consuming a skinful of your favourite poison, it's still a decent game in its own right.
