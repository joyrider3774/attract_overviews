Hoyle Book Of Games Volume 3: Great Board Games is a Board games collection, developed and published by Sierra On-Line, Inc, which was released in Europe in 1992.

Six board games are transformed to the computer screen in the third HoyleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s release. Snakes & Ladders, Backgammon, Yacht / Yahtzee, Checkers, Dominoes and Pachisi / Parcheesi all feature, with animated graphics and sound effects. As there is no time-sensitive action, and the game rules are familiar, these packs were designed to appeal to a wider range of people than most computer games.

At least one human player is required - other players can be human or computer. The 18 computer opponents from the first HoyleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s game return, many of them modeled on other Sierra characters such as Larry Laffer, and again some play Ã¢â‚¬ËœgoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and some play Ã¢â‚¬ËœevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.
