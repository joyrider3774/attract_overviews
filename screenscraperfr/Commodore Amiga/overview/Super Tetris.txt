Discover the mystery of the four squares in TETRIS?. This game of skill was conceived by two Soviet programmers. Time is of the essence as you try to rotate and/or flip moving pieces to fit as they descend from the top of the screen. Make the pieces fit precisely with the others to form a compelte row with no blank spaces. The quicker you position each piece and allow it to drop into place, the better your score.
As complete rows are formed they automatically disappear from the screen. When ten rows have been successfully removed, you advance to a high level and the pieces descend faster. Therefore the further you get, the more challenging TETRIS? becomes.
