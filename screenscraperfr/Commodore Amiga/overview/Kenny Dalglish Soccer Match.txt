Whether on the filed playing, or off it managing, Kenny Dalglish has been more than successful, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rewritten both the record and fairy tale books!

The match is on! Type in the name of your team (and the opposition), set the difficulty and the length of game and away you go. You control the red team playing from left to right. The arrow shows which player you control (the closest to the ball). Before the game starts, Kenny will give you some valuable advice, ignore it at your peril! The player under your control will move in the direction you move the joystick. Pressing fire when the ball is near you will enable you to kick the ball. How far it goes depends on the direction the joystick is in, when you release the fire button.

Just two words as a conclusion: absolutely rubbish. The worst soccer game (if I can call it so) ever seen and played (means on all platforms). So, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t waste your time with this garbage, there is a certain Sensible Soccer waiting for you.
