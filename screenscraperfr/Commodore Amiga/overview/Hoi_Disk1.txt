Hoi is a Platform game, developed by Team Hoi and published by Hollyware Entertainment, which was released in 1992.

This was written by three young Belgians and it has taken them a lot of effort to get it in to the marketplace. And their time hasn't been wasted, because as platform games go Hoi has all the right ingredients: an undeniably cute hero, bright copper backgrounds and very smooth scrolling. But somehow it just fails to produce the addictively playable game it should.

There is a bit of the 'play till you get killed and the start again and remember what to avoid' syndrome to the game. Sometimes you are forced to take a jump into the unknown because the screen doesn't extend far enough for you to see where you're going. The design of the levels is simply not intelligent enough for this to be a truly enjoyable game. The first level is the worst, if you can make it to subsequent levels, then you may find yourself enjoying Hoi.
