Players of Infocom games are no doubt aware of the 'Interactive Fiction' tag put to their games Ã¢â‚¬â€œ meaning they are stories. Nevertheless, they are 'adventures' as well, in the general sense of the word, as well as in the computer-game sense. Or at least, they have been until now. The adventure game format is nothing if not flexible, and in Nord and Bert, Infocom have come a long way from the traditional text adventure. Regular fans may, whilst not disliking this text only game, be rather disappointed that this is not the type of game they have come to know and love.
Nord and Bert performs almost exactly the same as other Infocom games on screen. It has a parser, and indeed, the method of communicating with it is identical, too.

Eight short 'stories' comprise this little piece of nonsense, for nonsense it is, and nonsense is what it sets out to be. Each story involves the use of wordplay, and the words must be guessed or spotted by the player, to reach the end. A score is registered for each episode, and to complete it, the total must be achieved. The final section cannot be played until all the others, which may be played in any order, have been completed.

Full marks to Infocom for branching out with something highly original, and extremely cleverly put together. But do not play Nord and Bert expecting anything like any other Infocom you have ever played. You won't get it, and you will be disappointed. Do not play Nord and Bert if English is not your native tongue. Nord and Bert is a game of American wit. Do play it with a group of friends, perhaps over a few drinks.
