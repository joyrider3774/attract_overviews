The game tells of the chronicles of Anar and the mystical sword and shield whose magical aura protected the inhabitants of Anar for many centuries. Time Past these items into folklore history along with the Corsarians who supposedly guarded them. Anar has now been invaded by hordes of humanoids under the control of Suxar, and rumour tells that only with the combined force of the Sword and Shield will it be possible to defeat the invaders. You and a band of loyal men volunteer to find the enchanted artifacts and take on Suxar before time runs out.

What makes Legend any different than any other adventure then? Quite simply how the game unfolds. The way the story comes to life, as you move along the map is almost akin to reading a book, and when you are asked to make a decision, invariably the words you choose will be understood. The map can be expanded to take up the whole screen if you wish, and some of the pictograms are very realistic. There are bags of humour, and a very real need to communicate effectively with the other members of your party, although when there is fighting to be done it is left to you to get on with it.

The box contains a novelette, which does contain some clues, and a poster, but what won me over in this game is Legend Of The Sword's sheer playability. It's so user friendly, and there is even a help command which kicks in without you asking it to. Go get Legend Of The Sword right now and start having a ball.
