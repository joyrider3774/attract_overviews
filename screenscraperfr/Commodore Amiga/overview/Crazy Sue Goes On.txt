Crazy Sue Goes On is a Platform game, developed and published by Amiga Fun, which was released in Europe in 1992 as a cover disk of the Amiga Fun magazine by CompuTec Verla in Germany.

The people of Ereanor were relieved when the brave girl Sue destroyed the horrible sorcerer "Wizard of Doom". The liberation of Ereanor was followed by a three day's celebration. But a dark shadow fell over the Kingdom of Ereanor. The sinister "Mistress of Death", the sorcerers wife, is out to get even. Ereanor became a hell on Earth. People became destructive creatures, animals became killer beasts and even plants turned evil.

Sue was not harmed by any of the spells, and from now on lived in her own world, which was worse then her scariest nightmare. To take whatever was left of Sue's pride, the mistress of death kidnapped her teddy-bear...

That really did it!  Like she did once before with the "Wizard of Doom", she now decided to fight and beat the "Mistress of Death". Help Sue, and start your battle against evil itself.
