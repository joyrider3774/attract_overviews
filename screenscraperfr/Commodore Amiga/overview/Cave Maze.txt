Cave Maze is a text adventure of the classic Ã¢â‚¬Å“cave crawlÃ¢â‚¬Â genre, intended especially for a younger audience. It features colorful static image for each location, and a baby dragon character that acts as a companion, occasionally commenting on things or intervening (for example, if the player tries to do something dangerous). Most of the puzzles involve finding the right item that allows passage through a location, such as food to give to a hungry animal that won't let you pass. The game seems to have some amount of randomization, both in where objects are found, and also the layout of the cave itself.
