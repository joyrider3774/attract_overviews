Gotcha is an Action game, developed by Gemini and published by Prestige, which was released in Europe in 1991.

This game has colourful and attractive graphics but everything else is sub-par. The music is sort of monotonous (literally) and the SFX are thin and underused. Added to that, the animation is rather poor, the controls are a bit iffy, the level design is dire, etc.

On the brighter side, though, the weapons system is quite OK, if a bit conservative. But that and a few good graphics filled with primary colours are not enough to make this game any good. Average and, thus, passable.
