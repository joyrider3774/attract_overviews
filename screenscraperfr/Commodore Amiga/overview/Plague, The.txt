The Plague is a traditional shooter of the "run and gun" variety. The player walks through the four side-scrolling levels while shooting everything which moves. There is also bit of platforming and dodging involved: getting hit by enemies result the energy bar to go down which eventually leads to death. The protagonist wields a machine gun which can be upgraded by collecting power ups and makes a big blast when holding the fire button for a time. A limited amount of smart bombs can be used to kill everything on screen. The sprites are relatively big and every level has a boss.
