Roketz is a 360 degree scrolling shooter featuring gravity environment and thrust-and-turn gameplay similar to the likes of Thrust, Virus, and SubSpace. Just like the latter, Roketz is an excellent multiplayer game. The fast paced dogfights guaranteed high levels of adrenaline for countless hours. The game boasts very nice ray-traced graphics and a wide variety of weapons to choose from.

Each battleground has different obstacles: gun turrets, pulsating force fields, etc. And of course, gravitational force constantly drags you down, so you will need both precise piloting skills and reflexes to succeed. The locations are nicely varied, although most of the action takes place in old production facilities rather than open space. Overall, if you enjoy classics like Thrust or Gravity Force, Roketz is well worth your time.
