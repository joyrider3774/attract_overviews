Vindex is a simplistic arcade style pseudo-3D space age shoot-em-up, featuring special visual effects like scaling sprites and slickly animated grid-style scrolling terrain. 

The execution of the game can effectively be similarly likened to the play-style arrangement of Segaâ€™s classic Space Harrier. The player navigates a spaceship around the screen, while the object is to neutralise the oncoming swirling armadas of aliens.  

Points are awarded for each nasty dispatched, and the usual extra life is granted for specific scoring sums. There is a grand total of nine levels to blast your way through to ultimately save the galaxy.
