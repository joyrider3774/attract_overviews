Gunship 2000 is a game which achieves the tricky task of balancing technical accuracy with playability. It doesn't bog the player down with endless pages of numbers and statistics, and you can happily bounce your helicopter off the ground without worrying about falling out. It has lots of scope, starting the player off on simple fly-about missions, and giving the opportunity to retire and play general by directing others about. The kind of game that could keep the occasional player going for months.
