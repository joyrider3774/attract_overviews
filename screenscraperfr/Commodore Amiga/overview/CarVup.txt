The gameplay involves controlling a cartoon-like car called Arnie, jumping from platform to platform and avoiding enemies. If the time limit of level was reached a demon like creature called Turbo was released which homed in on the play within 15 seconds and this would cost the player a life.

The objective of the game was to drive over every platform in the level which changed the platform in some way (for example, in the construction zone the platforms are girders with holes for rivets. A rivet would appear in the hole once it was driven over), once every platform was run over Arnie would be picked up by a helicopter and taken to the next level. At the end of three levels, Arnie would rescue an animal friend and continue on to the next themed level.
