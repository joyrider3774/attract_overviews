Geisha is an erotic adventure game. A mad scientist kidnapped the protagonist's girlfriend Eva, and wants to transform her into some sort of a futuristic geisha (half-machine, half-human). The hero travels to Tokyo and must face various dangers to prevent this from happening. 

The game uses a point-and-click interface (with mouse support) and has several small sub-games included, such as a simple card game, a jigsaw puzzle with a time limit, a short arcade sequence, and others.
