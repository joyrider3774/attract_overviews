1990 saw the release of Mysterious Worlds on the Amiga systems, a Platform game, created by PlayStone and published by Amiga Fun on a Coverdisk for free.

Funny game this. The sounds and graphics were an absolute joy but the gameplay was awful. Controlling the character is close to impossible. You are given three lives but if you collect all the items you need and then die, the level is impossible to complete because you no longer have the weapon you need to beat the boss. The time limits are ridiculous and the logic needed to beat the bosses is bizarre. Add to that the 'English' translation of the story is totally incomprehensible.

Yet the graphics, sound and the fact that there is a bit of parallax scrolling thrown in to each level makes you desperately want to overlook all of the blindingly obvious flaws. There's just something about it which is addictive.
