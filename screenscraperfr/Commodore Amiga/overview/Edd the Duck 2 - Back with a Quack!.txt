I don't know about you, but I find Andi Peters' sidekick to be one of the most irritating things ever to grace my TV, and the thought of two games based on the same character is enough to send shivers down my spine. But still I sit here playing it, and I have to admit that, even with my low expectations, I was disappointed. With the exception that the main character is a duck, this game has almost nothing to do with the inbred son of Sweep from the Sooty show. Surely the most obvious thing to do would be to sample his kazoo voice, but no. This Edd quacks.

The game falls somewhere between Treasure Island Dizzy and Fantasy World Dizzy, with a little Dizzy thrown in for good measure. In short, it is a scrolling platform game with attempted cute graphics and very little in the way of lasting gameplay.

As Edd you must travel through the Wild West in your best cowboy outfit, avoiding such terrors as large cowboy hats and electric sparks that travel up and down telegraph wires. Most of this is done by jumping, although you can use your gun to shoot down the opposition. Hang on a moment - Edd the Duck with a gun? Surely not! Well, OK then, it is not a real gun. All this weapon is capable of firing are custard pies which merely stun the enemy for a short period of time.

Everything about this game reeks of budget quality. Fine if you want a five-minute platform game, but there are so many better examples of the genre about.
