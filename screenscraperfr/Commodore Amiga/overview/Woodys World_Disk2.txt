Woody is an elf who has to retrieve a magical crystal which was stolen by evil forces. To do so, he has to travel through six worlds with overall 60 levels. The game plays out as a regular platformer in which Woody walks through the level, collects power-ups, avoids obstacles (e.g. blocks with nail traps or others which crash when touched) and defeats enemies by jumping on their head.
