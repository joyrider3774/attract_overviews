MicroProse Formula One Grand Prix is a Racing game, developed and published by MicroProse, which was released in 1991.

Coming from those clever people, MicroProse, Formula One Grand Prix is, not surprisingly, almost a flight simulation. With detailed, complex game play, not to mention the MicroProse trade mark huge manual and one trillion camera views, FOGP is by no means an easy game to get into. That said, however, it you do have the time and patience to learn, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a excellent game waiting to be found.

Though the on-screen graphical effects are sometimes a bit sparse, the action is smooth and fast, while the car emits a whole selection of, er... car-like noises in a very car-ish way.
Formula One Grand Prix shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be mistaken for a simple Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbash round the trackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ affair, as it is, to give credit where creditÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s due, more of a racing simulation.
