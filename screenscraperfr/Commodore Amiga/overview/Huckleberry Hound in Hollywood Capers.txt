As famous dogs go, this one is up there with the best of them. Fred Bassett, Lassie, Snowy, Muttley, Bouncer, Deputy Dawg, Rin Tin Tin, Nipper, K-9, Pickles, a quick office straw poll revealed other dogs of repute, but none of these venerable hounds have had their own game after them. Anyway, HuckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s treasured films Oscars have been half-inched and he has got to sniff around Cartoon World to goldenly retrieve them.

IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to know exactly how long they spent working out the insulting excuse for a plot. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d quite like to be told exactly how the Ã¢â‚¬ËœHollywood CapersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of the title relate to the platforms-against-a-wibbly-green-and-black-background that comprises the games graphics. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be quite pleased to learn if the programmers had any tricky moments drawing the total of four different frames required for Huck to walk and jump in two directions. 

A barkingly mad platformer, Huckleberry Hound is not, I am afraid, the dogÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s danglies. There are plenty of levels, but the gameplay is poor and the sprites are about as animated as something not very animated. The revolutionary gameplay has you scaling platforms, collecting diamonds and dodging drips of gooey stuff.

If there was an award for the worst use of a character license in a platform game, this would walk away with it, no problem. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s horrifying to think that someone actually programmed this, and then had the front to release it.
