Fallen Angel is a Beat 'Em Up game, developed by Emerald and published by Screen 7, which was released in Europe in 1989.

He had been the best! The trains on his patrol had been free from crime. He had seen to that. But the death of his 'Green Beret' brother from a drug overdose sent him over the edge. Seeking vengeance he hounded drug dealers and showed no mercy when he caught them. He became known as a Renegade,  the FALLEN ANGEL.

Wearing his brother's beret as a tribute, he was a familiar sight on the New York subway network. A men to be avoided at all costs. Then came a break. By chance he uncovered an international drugs ring which was using the subway systems of major cities as a distribution network. The destruction of these people became his only goal.

Traveling from country to country to seek out then eradicate the local chapters of every drug ring became his deadly mission. He became the Judge, the Jury and the executioner, an Angel of Death. FALLEN ANGEL is a fantastic scrolling arcade-action game spread across three major city rail networks. Beat your way up and down the trains and platforms of the London Tube, Paris Metro and New York Subway systems.

Find and destroy the local drug dealers and their henchmen. But beware! Your adversaries are not just highly trained thugs, but often crafted drug fiends, oblivious to pain.
