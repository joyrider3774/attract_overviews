Alright, all you smirking football-management-game haters. Scram and get lost. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be none of the usual gratuitous teasing of soccer strategy in this review, no whinging about elementary BASIC programming, and definitely no whining about blocky graphics. I don I care if IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m the only person in Amigadom to still play these things

Mind you. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have to be pretty fanatical not to admit that the fortunes of footy power games have slumped alarmingly over the past two or three years. Now - at last! - weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got something new that promises to incorporate reasonably complex gameplay with sweet graphics and still work without being plagued by bugs and inconsistencies. The game is management specialists D&H GamesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ upgraded version of their three-year-old Football Director II, and - I hate to say it - itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disappointingly ragged.

Football Director II now includes a few extra options - such as the ability to see whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on in European competitions and other leagues - and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a reasonably user-friendly game environment, but none of this has made the gameplay any more interesting. The trouble is, Football Director II really needed a total revamped, not just to get cosmetically touched up.

It would be too tedious to bang on about every sub-standard aspect of the game, but (suffice to say) it offers little that wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t available half a decade ago. A real disappointment for those of us who were hoping for something exceptional - not even the patronage of us die-hard footy freaks will sustain much more of this stuffy repetition.

THE BOTTOM LINE: A disappointing affair which doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really offer anything new. Fans of the genre will not be impressed, and everybody else will need little warning to stay away.
