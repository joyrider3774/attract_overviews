The game's objective is to "Build an empire to stand the test of time": it begins in 4000 BC and the players attempt to expand and develop their empires through the ages from the ancient era until modern and near-future times.

The A1200 version looks and plays even better with a beefed-up graphics palette and stereo sound samples. The overall look of the game has been changed in a subtle way - waves lap the shore on the map screens while the animations have become smoother and more detailed. The sound effects also help to boost the game's realism with strident martial music when you come under attack, or hammering sounds when you're building one of the world's Great Wonders.
