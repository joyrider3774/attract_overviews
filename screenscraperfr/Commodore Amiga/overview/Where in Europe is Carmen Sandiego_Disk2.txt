Where in Europe Is Carmen Sandiego? is a 1988 European geography-based educational video game in the detective mystery franchise Carmen Sandiego. It was originally published by Broderbund in 1988 for Apple I , Commodore 64 and MS-DOS , and ported to the Apple IIGS , Amiga and Macintosh in 1989. It is the third Carmen Sandiego title, after world-based Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1985) and US-based Where in the USA Is Carmen Sandiego? (1986). Under the guidance of The Acme Agency's chief, the player completes cases to catch Carmen's henchmen; they accomplish this by traveling to European locations to investigate clues relating to the crook's last known whereabouts, and by gaining enough character data to issue a warrant of arrest. Once the player has captured all 15 thieves, they are able to chase after Carmen herself.
