Charly is a Soko-Ban variant. In each top-down level, the player has to push crates on especially marked fields. However, there is one important difference to the original: crates can also be pulled. In turn there is a limitation of moves in place. One move equals pulling or pushing a crate one field. There are also cracked tiles which cause a life loss when stepping on them and randomly appearing power ups.
