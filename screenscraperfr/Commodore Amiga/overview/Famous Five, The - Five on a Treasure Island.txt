Enid Blytons wizard Famous Five books have sold simply squillions of copies world-wide and have been translated into dozens of languages. Now you get the chance to play the super Five as they embark on a spiffing adventure to a mysterious treasure island.

Based on the book Five On A Treasure Island, we find our courageous heroes Julian, Anne, Dick, George and Timmy the dog holidaying with their Aunt Fanny in the town of Kirrin. Nearby is the mysterious Kirrin island and its hidden treasure...

The game is a run of the mill adventure with some natty pictures. The puzzles are usually quite straightforward, though some really do need some brain-work. None of the five can get hurt, though they seem to be good at getting lost or trapped.

The parser is jolly whizzo. It understands lots and lots of commands; Julian was really surprised when he attempted to kick uncle Quentin and was sent home!

Five On A Treasure Island is a very risky licence which has been produced in an absolutely super way. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a faithful reproduction of a book that has thrilled many children over the years. Fans of the book will adore this; anyone else might just throw up.
