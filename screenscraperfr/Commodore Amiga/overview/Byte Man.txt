Byte Man is over-the-top version of Pacman and it definitely could use an editor. The first few of the 32 levels struck me as rather similar. Problem is that game doesn't offer anything much different from the game that inspired it. That mold-covered original have already been cloned to death, and I'm not sure there's a need for more. It's sort of a shame, too, as the energy and enthusiasm that went into the game is evident right down to the pre-game and between-level screens.
