The back story takes place in 2461 A. D. and concerns an Earth colony being lost on an alien planet known as Jurica. The space station Hybris cannot establish communications with the colony. So a scout ship must be sent on a rescue mission over this seemingly desolate desert-like expanse to find the colonists, and subsequently return them to safety. Warning: Inbound Hostiles.
