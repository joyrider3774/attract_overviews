Captain Planet and the Planeteers was a video game released for various platforms in the early 1990s, loosely based on the environmentalist animated series, Captain Planet and the Planeteers and produced by the third party developer Mindscape Inc.

The Amiga/Atari version has five stages, one for each planeteer, and a final stage in which Captain Planet could be controlled. Each planeteer stage has at least one objective, while some had two: to clean up pollution using the planeteer's magic ring power, and/or to rescue a particular type of animal with the aid of one of the planeteer vehicles. Completing the objectives opens the exit gate for the level; touching environmental hazards or the unusual monsters in the level will lose the player a life, while failing the objective by killing any of the animals will crack the planeteer's ring depicted at the bottom of the screen (in the Amiga version), opening the level's exit gate early. The final level allows the player to control Captain Planet, who must navigate to the end of the stage by using and swapping powers held in bubbles throughout the level, before defeating one of the ecovillans, which is either Hoggish Greedly, Dr. Blight and her computer MAL, Looten Plunder and his assistant Argos Bleak, or Duke Nukem.
