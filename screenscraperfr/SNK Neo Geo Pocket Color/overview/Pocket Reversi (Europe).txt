Pocket Reversi is an adaptation by Success of the classic strategy game. In single-player, you must make your way through Tournament Mode, competing against eight progressively difficult opponents. You can also take the 'Ability Level Test' which grades you based on your play. For beginners, 'Reversi Lesson' provides ten short tutorial sessions to teach you the basics of the game. There's also a 'Free Play' mode where you can choose to see all available moves and to even take back your last move. Finally, there's a two-player mode accessible via the link cable.
