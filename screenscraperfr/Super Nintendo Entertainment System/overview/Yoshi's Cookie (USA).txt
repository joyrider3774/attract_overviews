A Japan-only edition of Yoshi's Cookie developed to promote A new Kuruppon oven. Only 500 copies of the game were produced, and are now very expensive collector's items. While an identical copy of the SNES version of Yoshi's Cookie is included, an additional mode is available in which Yoshi moves around on a map similar to Super Mario World's, navigating a small, unknown island. By surveying around and selecting areas, Yoshi is able to cross bridges, hop over blocks, and swim river streams. Along his tour, Yoshi teaches recipe tutorials in the local buildings that players can use to bake real versions of the cookies featured in the game such as Checkerboard Cookies, Heart Cookies, and Flower Cookies.
