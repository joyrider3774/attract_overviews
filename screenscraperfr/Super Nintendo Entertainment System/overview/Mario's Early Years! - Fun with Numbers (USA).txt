In FUN WITH NUMBERS, children are introduced to the basics of math by way of Shape, Number, Same and Different, Counting, Comparing, How Many, and Pattern Worlds.

Children simply guide Mario, selecting objects on the screen, which playfully illustrate numerical concepts. Moms and Dads get to interact and play, too. Mario invites them to join in the fun and observe their children as they become totally involved in the learning process. Through the MARIO?S EARLY YEARS Series children will discover the world around them by exploring the elements of that world. The MARIO'S EARLY YEARS Series covers a multitude of subjects, helping children to acquire valuable skills and develop a rich and active imagination.
