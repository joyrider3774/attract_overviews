HIT THE COURTS! Play some serious b-ball with America's hottest Rappers -- including Warren G, Public Enemy, Queen Latifah, Naughty by Nature, Yo-Yo, LL Cool J, House of Pain, Coolio and Onyx -- each with a special slammin' move. Mow 'em down with unbelievable Hang Time Jams! Crush the defense with a Helicopter Jam and slice 'em with a Somersault Slam.

Forget regulation play -- it's survival of the fittest when you're pushin', shovin' and jammin' in the streets of Chicago, L.A., New York, Houston and Atlanta.

No rules. No refs. Lots of fun.
