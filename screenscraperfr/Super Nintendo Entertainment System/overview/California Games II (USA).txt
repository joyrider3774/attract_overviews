Prepare to shred dudes and dudettes (and we don't mean cheese). Hang Gliding target practice, Skateboarding in the aqueducts, Snowboarding on Mt. Shasta, Bodyboarding in Santa Cruz and Jet Surfing on Monterey Bay await your most excellent presence. Up to eight different people can play in the competition. Get the highest overall score and you can become the Supreme Dude or Dudette of the beach. Just show Zak what you're made of. He's the guru who hands out the points. But don't worry, he's real easy to impress...Not!
