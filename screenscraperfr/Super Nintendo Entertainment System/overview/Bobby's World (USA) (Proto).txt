A game developed by Siedel Software Productions and was to be published by Hi-Tech Expressions that was completed but never released. Based on the Howie Mandell cartoon of the same name. There are five levels in the game. Each level represents one of Bobby's imagination inspired adventures he goes on as he is cleaning his room. Bobby is to make it safely to each course and defeat the boss at the end of each level to proceed. The more lollipops Bobby collects in each stage, the more points Bobby gets. Bobby's health meter consists of six hearts. In order to make it through successfully Bobby must get through with at least on heart remaining. Bobby can defeat enemies throughout the stages by throwing objects at them and can use Webbly to hang on and climb across wide pits.
