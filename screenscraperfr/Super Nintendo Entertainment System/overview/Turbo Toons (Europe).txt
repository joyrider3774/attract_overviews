A top-down racing game released exclusively in Europe; a US version was in development but cancelled before its release. The player as one of six characters from the Hanna Barbera universe must race against the other five in a series of twisty races. Various other characters make cameo appearances.

Top Cat, Snagglepuss, Hong Kong Phooey, Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound and Quick Draw McGraw are the six playable characters. Others, like Squiddly Diddly and Atom Ant, make cameo appearances on specific courses. Captain Caveman is used for the countdown that starts every race.
