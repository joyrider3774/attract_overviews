This game consists of five 3-day tournaments at four lakes. The mission is to catch as much large bass as possible. Once the day of the fishing tournament is over, the five largest bass that were caught get weighed and are compared to the other fisherman's catches. The one with the heaviest catch is the winner. The player starts off choosing an angler. Then the player can either go to the bait shop, practice pond, or start in the tournament. In the bait shop, choices of baits, lines, rods, reels, fish finders, and boat engines are available for purchase. The practice pond mode is just where the player can cut his teeth on the game mechanics without consequence.
