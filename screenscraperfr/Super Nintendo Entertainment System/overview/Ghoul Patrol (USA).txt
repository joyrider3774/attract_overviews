The main attractions at the library's Goblin exhibit have come to life! As the Ghoul Patrol, go back in time and de-spook an encyclopedia of zombified historic dudes. Vaporize garbage-can ghosts and Ninja spirits, rescue bug-eyed librarians and wigged-out pirates, dodge flying books and adolescent-eating plants, and ultimately put the beastly spirit back in the history books!

- 2-Player Cooperative mode lets you team up for a double dose of ghost busting adventure
- A cemetery full of enemies including skeletal knights, zombified samurais and possessed automobiles
- A potent potpourri of power-ups to collect, including rubber chickens and magic potions
- Cool weapons to use, from plasma rifles to suction-cup arrows
