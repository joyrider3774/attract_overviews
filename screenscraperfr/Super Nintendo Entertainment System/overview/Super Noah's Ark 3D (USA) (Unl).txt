It's been a long journey. In just a few days, the ark doors will open and Noah, his family & the animals will be back on dry land. But the animals have become a bit restless and are out of their cages. Camels, giraffes, monkeys, kangaroos and more are wondering throughout the corridors of the ark. As Noah, it's your job to regain order & get the animals to sleep until you leave the ark. You only tool to accomplish this in the food you brought aboard the ark.
