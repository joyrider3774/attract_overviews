Everything from treacherous right turns to gasoline is simulated as the player tries to win the FIA World Drivers' and Constructors' Championships. The player can play a single race (non-championship Formula One race) or a season mode where the winner takes all, and the losers can wait until next year. This game is based on the 1992 Formula One season. The player's default role is a driver on the Footwork Racing team (Aguri Suzuki's old team), though they can choose to race with pastiches of five other teams, namely McLaren, Ferrari, Williams, Benetton and March.
