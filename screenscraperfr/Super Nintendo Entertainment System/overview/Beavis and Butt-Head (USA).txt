Beavis and Butthead are on the couch watching television. While flipping through the channels they come across an ad for a GWAR concert. Now they want to go to the GWAR concert, but they have no money for concert tickets. So in their infallible logic, they think that if they take pictures of themselves doing cool things, they will be able to get into the concert for free.

The game contains four main levels which are Highland High School, Streets of Highland, Highland Hospital and the Turbo Mall 2000 and the final level at the concert.
