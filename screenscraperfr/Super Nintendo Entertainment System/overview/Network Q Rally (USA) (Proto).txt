This car rally game was canceled in full development and never went out. The rom available on the net is however perfectly playable and seems to offer a game almost complete even if we feel that it lacks a lot of things that are usually found in this kind of softs (settings of the car, choice between automatic gearbox and manual ... etc ...). In the state, the game still allows us to play a championship on 4 different tracks.
