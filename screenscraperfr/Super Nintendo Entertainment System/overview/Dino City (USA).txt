Timmy and his friend, Jaime go into Timmy's father's lab to watch a movie on the big screen. Little do they know that the big screen is actually a time machine. When Timmy touches the remote they are both sucked into prehistoric times. Now in order to return home they must reclaim a time machine fuse that was stolen by some Neanderthals who go by the name of "The Rockies". The Rockies are also looking to destroy DinoCity, so two dinosaurs named Rex and Tops decide to help out the two human children in their fight against the Neanderthals.

Gameplay involves one of the humans riding one of the dinosaurs throughout six stages, To defeat the enemies, the player can jump on top of them, punch them, or throw projectiles at them. Defeated enemies may drop eggs. It is also possible for the human to dismount the dinosaur. The human will now be able to jump and reach higher places. 

The player can only take three hits before losing a life. Energy can be refilled by finding hearts throughout a level. Time is of the essence as all stages are timed.
