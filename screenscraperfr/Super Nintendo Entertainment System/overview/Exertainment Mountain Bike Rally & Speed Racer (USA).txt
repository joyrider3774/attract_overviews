Exertainment Mountain Bike Rally/Speed Racer is a pack-in compilation of two racing/driving games: Mountain Bike Rally (best known as Cannondale Cup) and Speed Racer in My Most Dangerous Adventures, both of which were released separately the month following this release. Both games have been configured to work with Life Fitness's "Exertainment"-brand stationary bike, which came built with an electronic component that could be linked to the Super Nintendo. The player's own exertions on the bike would power the protagonists' vehicles within the two games.
