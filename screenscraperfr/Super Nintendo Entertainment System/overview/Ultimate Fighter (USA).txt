A beat-em-up for the SNES, this game features two styles of fighting genre: one-on-one fighting (like Street Fighter) and side scrolling brawling (Like Final Fight).
 
Golden Fighter is very camp and colourful: the player's character can best be described as The Ultimate Warrior (the 80's wrestler) on LSD. Locations too, are very bright and tacky: comprising of strip clubs and casinos.
