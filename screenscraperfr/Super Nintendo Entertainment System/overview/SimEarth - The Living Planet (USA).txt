An entire planet becomes your laboratory in this large-scale simulation game. Players help foster new life and promote its evolution into lifeforms of higher intelligence. Guide civilization along the path of evolution until it can achieve Exodus, the ultimate goal of settling on another planet. The basic challenge of the game is to maintain a comfortable environment for the lifeforms by adjusting atmosphere and geological parameters. Small organisms called Prokaryote and Trichordate will grow and evolve into a multitude of lifeforms. Making a drastic change is a recipe for disaster. The key to success is to make small adjustments and see how the lifeforms react. SimEarth also includes planets with environments different from Earth, such as Mars and Venus. Try your hand at terraforming these planets with harsh conditions into a world where life can thrive.
