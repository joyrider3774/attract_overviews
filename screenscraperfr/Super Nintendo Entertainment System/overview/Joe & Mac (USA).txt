Back in the distant past (way back - like when â€œrock and rollâ€ was just rock and fast food was dinner you couldnâ€™t catch), lived two cave dudes named Joe and Mac.  Whether it was dinosaur demolition or pterodactyl hang-glidinâ€™, life for the boys was pretty cool.

Cool, that is, until a bogus bunch of neanderthal nerds crashed their village and scared off all the cave-babes.  Now the cave-babes are out there - SOMEWHERE, lost and reeeeally lonelyâ€¦ so what are you waitinâ€™ for?  Itâ€™s up to Joe and Mac to get â€˜em back.
