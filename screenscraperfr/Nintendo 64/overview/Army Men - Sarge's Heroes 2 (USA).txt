Sarge's Heroes 2 starts where Sarge's Heroes left off. It is announced that the capture of Field Marshal Tannenberg will end the war. Since General Plastro has disappeared, it is suggested that he has become a victim of plastrification and been trapped in the real world. The game introduces Bridgette Bleu, a spy for the Blue Nation. She has developed a serum that reverses plastrification. Your job as Sarge and sometimes Vikki is to destroy the serum, eliminate Tan soldiers, and capture Plastro and Tannenburg.
