The WonderBorg is a programmable consumer robot kit that was bundled with specialized software known as "Robot Works", which is used to program the robot. 

While mainly used to program the movement of the physical robot, it also comes with a game where your aim is to get a virtual WonderBorg from start to finish with predetermined instructions: you first see the map, then give a series of instructions "two forward, turn left, one forward" etc and then run your program to see whether you managed to get the robot over the finish line.
