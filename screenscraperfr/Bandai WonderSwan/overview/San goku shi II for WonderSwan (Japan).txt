Sangokushi II, or Romance of the Three Kingdoms II, is a video game based on the historical novel of the same name by Luo Guanzhong. It was developed and published by Koei in 2000 for the WonderSwan and is the sequel to the first game released in 1999.
Upon starting the game, players choose from one of six scenarios that determine the initial layout of power in ancient China. The scenarios loosely depict allegiances and territories controlled by the warlords as according to the novel, although gameplay does not follow events in the novel after the game begins. The player wins the game by conquering all territories in China. This is accomplished by being in control of every province on the map.
