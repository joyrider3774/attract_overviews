At the start, there's sniper machine gun fire from the bushes.  When the shooter stops briefly to reload, you can run past.  To reach the 2nd woman, you have to jump over the lake.  Run until the last moment (your heel is on the edge), then press the button to jump.  If you jump too soon, you fall into the water.  After the woman on the island, you move to the level above, where you have to run by a fire-breathing dragon.  You have to time it right to run by when he pauses blowing fire.  You can only make it to the hole in the ground.  Push the button to drop in, and a woman appears.  If you get too greedy here, she turns into a snake and... Ow!  Time leaving the pit to avoid the dragon, and run off the screen to the left.  You will then be on the top level, where you have to chase a woman.  Meanwhile, gargoyles appear in random positions and drop molten lava.  If a gargoyle appears over you when you are "scoring points" with her (listen for the warning sound), you must push the button to release her and run.  You can catch her again, and continue indefinitely, except that the gargoyles speed up each time you catch her.  When you get to 69 points you get another life (you start out with 3).
