It's Christmas Eve and Santa can't find the reindeer! oh no!
How will he deliver the toys to all the boys and girls?
Where, oh where, could they be? He'll have to go find them!

In Reindeer Rescue you must help Santa rescue his lost reindeeer in a journey that has you starting at the North Pole, racing through frozen tundra, ice caves, suburbia, and the big city! But Santa is not the athlete he used to be (1943 state champion in 400m), he has grown a little...girthy around the middle. He doesn't have quite the energy he used to and if it drops too low he'll fail in his task! Along the way Santa will encounter many objects in the air and on the ground, some will help and some will hinder, so be be carefull!
