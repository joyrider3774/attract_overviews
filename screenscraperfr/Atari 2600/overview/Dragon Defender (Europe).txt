The object of the game was to take control of a dragon that had to fight its way through waves of attackers that came at you from the right hand side of the screen. Strange ball type enemies came at you but although they did not fire at you but they could destroy you if they ran into your dragon. Large saucers would make an appearance and these would shoot at you and required four hits to destroy them. Each hit reduced them in size until they resembled a small alien invader that moved up and down the screen. 

On the bottom of the screen a strange creature would attempt to make his way past you but you could bomb him as he crawled past.
