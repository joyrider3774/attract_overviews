You are a local leading-lady and all the uptown boys are standing in line for a date, but a savvy soda-slinger just around the corner is more down your alley and you just can't seem to get enough of his famous fountain treats. Most evenings the joint's a jumpin', the city's clamoring for that counter-Casanova's premium hand-packed ice cream, and to prove you are the only girl in town who can make his soda pop, you will have to apply yourself to matters at hand and stay one jump ahead of the crowd. Demonstrate your heart is in the right place (at the right time) and you will be certain to get all that's comin' to you.
