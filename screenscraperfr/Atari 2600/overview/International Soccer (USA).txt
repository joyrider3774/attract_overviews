This Game is 2-Player Only. In this version of soccer, each player controls 4 men, though only one at a time. The computer moves the other 3 for you. A computer-controlled goalie will help out when a goal attempt is made. Kick the ball around for 90 minutes, and try to score more than your opponent.
