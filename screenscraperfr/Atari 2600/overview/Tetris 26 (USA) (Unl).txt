Until now, I've never encountered a bad version of Tetris. Obviously, some ports are better than others, but the game is kind of like Pong; as long as you get the basic mechanics right, you're golden. Tetris 26, however, feels unfinished ? almost like a homebrew prototype. With all apologies to programmer Colin Hughes (this is apparently his only homebrew to date), Tetris 26 is just not very good. It lacks the smoothness of the best versions of the game; adjusting the puzzle piece to fit is particularly jarring as your piece flashes as it rotates. The colours of a Tetris game should be bright and vibrant but this version is dull and washed out. And sound? Unless there's something wrong with my copy, there literally is no sound.
