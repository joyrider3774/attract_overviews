If you think you're good, think again! Start as a white belt battling another white belt in a 2-minute match of wits, skill and force. As your opponent steps toward you, do you stand your ground or step back or move into him? You block some of his kicks and punches, but how much can you take? Time ticks away, so you move in to unleash your arsenal of kicks and punches, trying for that elusive knockdown! When you win, you advance one belt: from white to red... all the way up to black belt expert. But when you lose, your opponent gets even tougher in the next match. You have to be good... or you may take the beating of your life!
