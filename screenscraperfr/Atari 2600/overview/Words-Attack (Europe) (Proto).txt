Extremely rare Sancho prototype. Only one cartridge is known to exist.

The game seems to be unfinished, because it still has over 1K of free space left that could have been used for a valid 'word pool'.

This game was most probably originally made by Home Vision, because a Home Vision logo has been found inside this ROM
