Cubis 2 is a puzzle video game that was released in 2004 by FreshGames. In Cubis 2, the player shoots different colored cubes into cubes that are already placed on the isometric game table. Once three of the same color are matched in a row or are stacked, the cubes disappear and the player earns points. Once the board is clear or enough points are earned, the player advances to the next board which features a new animated backdrop.
