You were one of the first ones to reach Earth when you heard about the cool new LIMITED EDITION release of ALIEN GREED. Actually you got here a little too fast. I guess that braking thing wasn't such a waste of time after all. Well, You are here in one piece but you can't say the same about your ship. Pieces is more like it. Time to go round up all of those shiny new cartridges before your rivals get here. 

Oh no!! It can't be! They are here! And they took the time to slow down! That means they can use their transporters. Hurry up and grab those carts before they beam them away! Oh, And watch out for the Bees!!
