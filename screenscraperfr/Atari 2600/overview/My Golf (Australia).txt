This golf game (as you couldn't tell by the title) comes from HES games.  It is a pretty decent little game with some nice graphics of the golfer and even two different views of the greens.  You get the option of switching clubs and you have the power bar to gauge how hard you hit it. If you like golf games, then this will be a welcome addition to your  collection.  I am not a big fan of golf games, but still play this occasionally.
