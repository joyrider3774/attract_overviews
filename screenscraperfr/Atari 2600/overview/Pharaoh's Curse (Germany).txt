The Pharaoh's Curse, or simply Pharaoh's Curse, is a 1983 platform adventure game written by Steve Coleman and published by Synapse Software for the Atari 8-bit family. It was ported to the Commodore 64 and VIC-20. In Pharaoh's Curse the player attempts to collect 16 treasures from an Egyptian tomb while avoiding the pharaoh, his mummy, and various traps. Coleman also wrote Rainbow Walker for Synapse, published the same year.

John Szczepaniak, writing for GamesTM magazine, called The Pharaoh's Curse an early example of what later became known as the Metroidvania genre.
