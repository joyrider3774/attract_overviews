Your name is Captain Nalad Modnar and you are part of an advanced underwater civilization. It's your duty to patrol your section of the ocean in a semi-organic submarine called the Manatee. Highly aggressive seaweed surrounds you and it keeps trying to replicate faster than you can shoot. Use your torpedoes to blast any bits of seaweed that appear before they clog up your sector and spread to others, making it nearly impossible for anyone to travel. Don't let the seaweed strangle your civilization to extinction.

Seaweed Assault is an engaging and original homebrew title for the Atari 2600 by Duane Alan Hahn. You must deftly pilot your Manatee, avoiding seaweed that can damage your vessel, as well as Wrothopods, a protected species of cephalopods that travel deep to feed on parasites that attach to mature seaweed. Your goal is to keep the sea lanes free of seaweed, and to that end you must blast the seaweed with your torpedos. However, watch out for mature seaweed tentacles that reach up from the depths to try and grab your Manatee!

Some relief is offered in the form of Homing Health Canisters, which appear after you've shot 100 bits of seaweed. The more quickly you grab a canister, the more health units will be replenished for your Manatee. Be wary of corroded Homing Health Canisters, which you may uncover when clearing bits of seaweed! If you don't salvage these in time, their damaged circuits will home in on the Manatee and try to ram it, causing damage that will take one health unit to repair.
