The safety of a nearby aircraft carrier is in your hands. You are the ace of a supersonic F-22, the latest, most powerful airborne weapon ever created. Below is the carrier. Above is the enemy. Your buddies are nowhere in sight and it is up to you to clear the skies of devilish interceptors, stealth fighters, and bombers. Your ship is equipped with guided missiles, machine guns, proximity missiles, and the latest ultra secret RADAR LOCK tracking system. Remember, that carrier crew is counting on you. Good luck, Ace!
