An Adventure type game created by Steve Engelhardt in 2009.

Here are the differences between the three difficulty levels:

Game 1 - Beginner
Enemies move at normal speed and never have a fast attack
No health reduction when changing rooms
Keys are always hidden in the same rooms
You start out with your gun, and you will never lose it.

Game 2 - Intermediate
Enemies move at normal speed with occasional fast attacks
1 point health reduction when you change rooms only after you are down to 3 health blocks left
Key locations are randomized
You start out with no gun - you will have to find it, either in the hidden room or dropped by an enemy.

Game 3 - Advanced
Enemies move at top speed all the time
1 point health reduction when you change rooms at all times
Key locations are randomized
You start out with no gun - you will have to find it, either in the hidden room or dropped by an enemy.
Falling rocks in the locked caves will fall twice as fast
