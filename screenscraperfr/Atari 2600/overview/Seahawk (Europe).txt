You command the Sea Hawk fighter plane in this military battle! Your mission is to destroy enemy helicopters and ships traveling through the battle zone. But watch out! Enemy ships will attack your Sea Hawk with ship-to-air missiles that can catch you off guard. And enemy helicopters will send a steady stream of machine gun fire your way. Winning depends on your steady hand and quick wits. If your Sea Hawk is hit, your pilot will parachute from it. But it will be up to you to save him by guiding him to one of your ships. If he lands in the ocean or on an enemy ship, he dies.
