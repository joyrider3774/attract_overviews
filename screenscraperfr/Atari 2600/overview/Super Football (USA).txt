Play selection
Offense selects both the formation and pattern that the receiver will run*. The formation is the number on the left, from 1 to 9. The pattern is the number on the right, from 1 to 4.

Defense only selects formations, from 1 to 9*. If the offense selects to punt or a field goal, the defense play is automatically selected to counter that.

To see the formations and patterns, you must refer to the game manual, as they are not named or graphically displayed on screen.
