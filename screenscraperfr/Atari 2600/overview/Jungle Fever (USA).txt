This is a double-ender cartridge with Jungle Fever on one end and Knight on the Town on the other.

Jungle Fever is just a gender-reversed version of Burning Desire in which your boyfriend is being held for sacrifice and you must rescue him while avoiding the rocks thrown by the amazons.

Knight on the Town involves you (the knight in question) building a bridge over the moat to reach the princess. You must contend with a castration-minded alligator and a troll. Also, if you select it, the bird above you will drop fire to remove one of your bridge sections. Once you reach your lady, you can get your "reward".
