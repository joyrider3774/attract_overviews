The final showdown has begun between the Alien Collector and Atari Charles for possession of the E.T. Prototype cartridge.

Look for cartridges hidden in the nearby forest but watch out for Mr. Detective (an avid Atari fan), who is investigating the area trying to locate a mythical Atari cartridge stash!

There seems to be pits all over the forest. Be careful you don't fall into one on your journey.

Keep on your toes while collecting and beware of the dread Atari Charles who may be lurking in the area after having been turned into a mutated E.T. monster by his obsession with the E.T. Prototype cartridge.

YOU MUST COLLECT THEM ALL!
