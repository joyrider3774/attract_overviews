This is a version of Scrabble for the Atari 2600.

The letters on the top row are shuffled and then you use them to make words on the bottom row. If the bottom row shows all spaces in pink or red, then the points for the word are doubled or tripled, respectively. If there is a light blue or blue line under a space, then the points for that letter are doubled or tripled, respectively. After you create a word, move down to the E button and press the red joystick button one time. This stops the timer so you can confirm the word is acceptable. If the word is acceptable, press the button again to collect points and go to the next round. If not, move to the P button to pass on the word and go to the next round. In a two player game, after you press the E button once, the other player then must press the button again to enter the word. Play continues until you have 14 rounds in a one player game or 7 each in a two player game.
