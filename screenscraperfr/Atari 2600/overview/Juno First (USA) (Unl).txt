There is no one left. No attack fleet. No reinforcements. Just you and a handful of reserve ships. Enemy forces are threatening the Juno colony-Earth's last defense post. You must fend off wave after wave of enemy ships, skimming dangerously above the planet's force field. How long can you hold them off? You must persevere-whoever controls Earth, must take Juno first!
