Video Simon by Mark De Smet is certainly the best-looking version of the Simon electronic game for the 2600 (the others being the Off Your Rocker prototype and Brain Games); for one thing, it actually looks like Simon. But damn ? someone needs to write an instruction manual for this thing, and seeing as Simon is a pretty intuitive game (it was designed for kids after all) that's not a good sign.

First of all, I'm kind of lost as to how I'm supposed to push the joystick (or press the keyboard keys as it were) to select one of the four light buttons. This really shouldn't be a problem ? Simon has four light panels and the 2600 joystick moves in eight directions; it's not rocket science. Oh and what a godawful noise this thing makes if you press the wrong light button ? just like the physical Simon except it just goes on and on and on. Sometimes the noise kicks in before you even have a chance to make your move.
