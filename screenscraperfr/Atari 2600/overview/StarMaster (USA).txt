Prepare to leave behind the world as you know it. You are at the controls of the most sophisticated and powerful space video game ever designed. Cruising through the blackness of deep space, you call up the galactic chart on your monitor. Radar reveals enemy starfighters closing in on one of the starbases you are sworn to protect. Your onboard computers instantly calculate the energy required to intercept. Fire up your engines and warp into hyperspace. Stars and meteor showers streak by as you enter an enemy sector. Then, the battle begins. Your laser cannons blast away at attacking enemy starfighters. But wait! Damage reports show enemy fire has destroyed your defensive shields. Quickly but carefully, you maneuver back through the galaxy to dock at your starbase for repairs. And, undaunted, you return to complete your mission.
