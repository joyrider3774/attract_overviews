The player controls a "Zapper" similar to a spaceship that can move on the screen and pull up, left and right. The goal is to draw the letters that spell out the current word in order, while avoiding the asteroids in the lower part of the screen. There are four types of asteroids and each has a different effect if it comes into contact with the Zapper. The asteroid "Doomsday" ends the game. The asteroid "Scroller" mixes scrolling letters for five seconds. Asteroids "Zonker" and "Bonker" hit the Zapper sideways.nnThe game ends after being hit by an apocalyptic asteroid, after the end of the time limit of 99 seconds or the ultimate goal of ending three words.
