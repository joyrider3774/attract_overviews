In this adaptation of the classic puzzler, gameplay is pretty much like any other clone of Tetris. All the familiar pieces we've come to know and love are all there, and the object is still to strategically place them such that complete rows are created so that the rows keep disappearing at the bottom. One deficiency found in all 2600 versions has to do with the inability to rotate the tiles in both directions. In Z-Blocks' case, the one fire button turns the tiles 90 degrees clockwise. It's not a hindrance to playability, but experts who relied on the option of flipping pieces in both directions will point to this omission as a sore spot. In every other facet, however, Z-Blocks has it covered.
