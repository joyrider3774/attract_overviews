Gundam Battle Tactics, released on September 22, 2005, is a third-person action/mech-combat simulation game for the PlayStation Portable, based on Japan's long-running mecha-based series, Gundam. Tactics, released only in Japan and South Korea, was later followed with a sequel, Gundam Battle Royale, also for the PlayStation Portable, in late 2006. This game follows the events of the One Year War and most scenarios are heavily influenced by animation episodes from One Year War storylines, namely Mobile Suit Gundam, The 08th MS Team, War in the Pocket, and Blue Destiny. This game plays similarly to another Bandai Gundam game for the Sony PlayStation 2, Mobile Suit Gundam: Lost War Chronicles.
