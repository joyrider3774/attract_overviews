Frantix is a puzzle-based adventure game for PSP. It features over 180 different levels. Playing as one of the heroes, the objective of the game is to collect as many gems as possible in order to advance in the world of Frantix. Though there is no story explaining why our hero is venturing through this land of puzzles, it is clear that this must be done as quickly as possible. Each stage has a gem requirement, and you can exit when you have found the required amount. The puzzles are usually based on colored gems that open specific doors.

There are six worlds (including a tutorial) where you get past hazards such as water and quick sands, avoid patrolling creatures, collect gems, manipulate crates, sneak around, build bridges, and plant explosives. There are also power-ups that allow you to walk over certain surfaces, increase speed, or provide invincibility. With short levels, Frantix can be played for five minutes or an hour with the same satisfaction.
