Two fighters enter the arena; the winner will move on in the tournament, the other will be dead. This tournament for control of Earth has been going on for centuries and continues in MORTAL KOMBAT 4. Choose from eight different characters: Fujin, Liu Kang, Sub Zero, Tanya, Quan Chi, Raiden, Reiko, Shinnok, Scorpion, and a few hidden characters as well. Each character has unique moves, combinations, and fatalities, and when you properly execute a fatality, a short animated reenactment plays. Throughout the game, there are special Kombat Kodes that are exclusive to the Game Boy Color, and you'll also get quite a bit of in-game speech. If you think you are the strongest fighter, prove it with MORTAL KOMBAT 4.
