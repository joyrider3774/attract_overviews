In PAPERBOY, all you have to do is deliver the newspaper to your subscribers. While this sounds easy enough, obstacles seem to constantly get into your way...things like dogs, kids on tricycles, traffic, and pedestrians. Since this is your neighborhood, you want punish those who do not subscribe to your paper, so you break their windows with rolled up newspapers. You will even hear the glass shatter thanks to the digitized sound effects and music! At the end of each level there is a bonus course, where you can demonstrate your newspaper-flinging accuracy and earn bonus points. Fortunately, there are three difficulty levels to help you get accustomed to the controls of the game. Will you become the master of your neighborhood or just another punk on a bike? Play PAPERBOY and find out.
