KLUSTAR takes TETRIS and twists it around. Rather than moving falling pieces, you must move and rotate a group of pieces that is stuck together. The goal is to get the moving pieces to stick together, forming a solid square of blocks. One that is done, the square disappears and the remaining pieces collapse inward, creating more room to maneuver. If you miss a piece, it will stick to the sides of the play area and cannot be removed. The game ends when the cluster of pieces becomes so big that it cannot fit into the screen. With 16 skill levels, the degree of challenge is always appropriate. If friends want to join the action, they can via a link cable. See how long you can last in KLUSTAR.
