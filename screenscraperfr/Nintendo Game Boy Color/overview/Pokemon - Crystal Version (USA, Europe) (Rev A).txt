Pocket Monster mania continues with Nintendo's release of Pokémon Crystal for the Game Boy Color. Much as 1999's Pokémon Yellow offered gentle enhancements to the basic story and gameplay of the original Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue games, Pokémon Crystal is based on the second-wave Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver releases.

Though it follows the same story told in the Gold and Silver versions, Pokémon Crystal has some new options and special features. For the first time, gamers have the choice to play as a female trainer in this version. Also, just as Pokémon Yellow included a special Pikachu, trainers are aided by an unusual Suicune in this release. Pokémon Crystal is designed to offer a complete Pokémon experience for those new to the ubiquitous phenomenon and additional challenges for seasoned trainers who simply have to catch 'em all.
