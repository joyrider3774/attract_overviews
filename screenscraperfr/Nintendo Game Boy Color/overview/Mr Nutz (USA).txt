Yeti wants to rule over the entire world, so he is using his magical powers to turn it into a large mass of ice. There is only one person who can save the day: Mr. Nutz the Squirrel. You take control of Mr. Nutz as he runs, jumps, swims, and flies through six different worlds. Along the way, you must collect acorns, coins, extra lives, and extra energy. Getting through the levels and collecting the goodies is no walk in the park, as there are plenty of bad guys waiting to stop you. Luckily, Mr. Nutz can dispose of them by jumping on their heads or whipping them with his giant tail. Will you be able to find all of the secrets and defeat Yeti in MR. NUTZ?
