A.A. Milne's beloved characters come to interactive life in this wonderful expedition through the Hundred Acre Wood. In order to ensure their party will be, Pooh and Tigger are going to need some honey (known in Milne's world as "hunny"). In fact, the duo will need to find dozens of pots full of the stuff, and that will mean searching the entire forest. Much to Pooh and Tigger's collective dismay, the area is populated by dozens of insects, angry animals, and environmental dangers. In addition to searching for the hunny, you'll have to help your pals find such popular characters as Rabbit, Piglet, and Owl, as well as unlocking dozens of hidden areas and special power-ups. Three mini-games Veggy Match, River Run, and Fence Off can also be uncovered, and you can save all of your progress and resume play with a password. The game spans 18 levels and five diverse environments including The Spring Glade, The Nighttime Forest, Autumn Heights, Creepy Caves, and Winter Wood.
