CARMAGEDDON brings all the carnage of the PC and Nintendo 64 action-racing games to the Game Boy Color. You play as one of the last survivors of a horrible disaster that has turned an entire city into zombies. Now you've got to take to the streets in a deadly race with other survivors. Use your weapons and driving skills to decimate your opponents and the zombified pedestrians that walk the streets. You'll find more than 30 different tracks of mayhem in four different areas, giving you plenty of replay value. Earn enough points and you'll upgrade your road machine to something with a bit more destructive power, and there are 18 different machines available for your use. Colorful graphics represent all the vehicular mayhem with speed and style, and a password function saves your progress through the game.
