Dr. Bunsen Honeydew has developed a new time machine, so he invites all of the Muppets over to see the new invention. However, something goes awry and the Muppets are sent back in time. Fortunately, Kermit and Animal were running late and were not involved in the mishap. Now these two must travel back in time and rescue their friends. You will take control of Kermit and Animal as they travel through six different time periods that contain a total of 24 levels. Help Kermit defeat enemies with paper airplanes, and use his super jump to collect items. Animal will pound enemies into submission with drumsticks and will shake items loose with his stomp. Will the two heroes be able to save the gang? Find out by playing JIM HENSON'S MUPPETS.
