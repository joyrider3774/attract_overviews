Good sportsmanship is the name of the game in this delightful series of sporting events. All of your favorite SESAME STREET characters are the competitors in these original contests, and winning (for once) is not the most important thing. Take the adorable athletes through six big time sporting events: Guide Grover through a unicycle race, lead Elmo into a roller skating contest, and push Ernie past the rapids in his own bathtub. Big Bird is along to conduct all of the post-game interviews, putting the emphasis of the events squarely on fun and fair play rather than heated competition. The game's controls are easy top learn allowing little gamers to get the hang of things quickly and an in-game tutorial teaches the ins and outs of each wacky sport. The excellent graphics and familiar faces make the game look and feel just like an episode of the classic kids' show. Hand-held sports have never been so fun!
