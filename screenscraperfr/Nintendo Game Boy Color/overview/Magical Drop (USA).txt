MAGICAL DROP has a character facing imminent doom as bubbles slowly make their way towards him from the top of the screen. To get rid of the bubbles, you can grab bubbles of one color from the pile and move them to another area. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch, they will explode and destroy all of the like-colored bubbles around them. When bubbles are destroyed, those remaining in the pile float up and cause more to bubbles to burst in a chain reaction. This is a rather simple premise, but it's not easy to master. While the single-player game is fun, use a link cable and share the fun with a friend. Try to clear as many bubbles as possible with MAGICAL DROP.
