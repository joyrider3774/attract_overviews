Are you looking to adopt a pet but lack the time or space to take care of a real one? Then you may find DOGZ to be of interest. Part of the small but popular virtual pet genre, DOGZ lets you adopt a dog from one of three breeds: Chihuahua, Scottie, or mutt. You can play with the pet first to decide if it's right for you. Once you've adopted the little gal or fella, it's up to you to take care of it: feed it, groom it, and play with it regularly if you want it to grow up to be a well-adjusted adult. If you mistreat your dog, though, your little pet will take off! Eventually, new breeds of dogs and new special toys will become available for you, depending on how well you do. You can even trade toys and breeds of dogs with your friends via the infrared link.
