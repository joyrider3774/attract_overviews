The action and excitement of using a big ball to knock down white pins comes to the Game Boy Color with POCKET BOWLING. Make your selection from six different bowlers, including an android. Once you have a bowler that matches your style of play, use the Training mode to work on picking up spares and to get the hang of the game controls. When you are ready for some action, play against a human or computer opponent in the Standard mode. If you want an extra challenge, try to win a tournament against four opponents in four different alleys. In all of the modes, getting the perfect shot requires lining it up, setting the proper amount of spin and power, and letting the ball go at the right time. Play POCKET BOWLING, and become master of the lanes.
