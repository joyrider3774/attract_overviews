What would you do if someone turned you into a llama? Based on the animated film from Disney, THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE casts you in the role of a young Incan ruler named Kuzco. When the evil Yzma turns Kuzco into a llama, our hero must make his way through eight action-packed levels in order to return to his archenemy for the ultimate showdown. That will require jumping gaps, negotiating moving platforms, breaking down barriers, unlocking closed doors, and more. Of course, all of Yzma's dastardly minions will be after you, but you'll have a variety of attacks to thwart their efforts including spitting! Along your path, you'll collect red and gold coins, water jugs, and plenty of Aztec coins. There'll be lots of obstacles along the way (watch out for scorpions!), but with your wits, skills, and reflexes, you might just have a chance at defeating your enemies and returning to the life that's rightfully yours. Good luck, llama!
