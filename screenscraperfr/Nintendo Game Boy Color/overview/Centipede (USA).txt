The classic arcade hit CENTIPEDE comes to Game Boy Color in this slightly enhanced version of the old favorite. This one- or two-player game has you firing pesticide at an oncoming centipede that is threatening the garden. As the pest weaves its way through the mushrooms dispersed throughout the screen, you'll have to use strategy as well as quickness to fight it off. The classic gameplay is replicated perfectly in this arcade port. You can play two players competitively by alternating on a single Game Boy, or grab two copies of the game and a Game Boy Link Cable to cooperate against the buggy bad guys. CENTIPEDE is enhanced for Game Boy Color, with all new brightly colored graphics that will take you back to the arcades of the '80s. Centipede is compatible with all Game Boy systems.
