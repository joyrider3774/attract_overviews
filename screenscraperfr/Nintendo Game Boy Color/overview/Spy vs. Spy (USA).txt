The Black Spy and the White Spy have feuded on the pages of MAD magazine for decades. Now they bring their feud to the Game Boy Color. You can play as either the Black Spy or the White Spy, with the goal being to outsmart your opponent and collect five objects hidden throughout the level. As luck would have it, you have an infinite number of booby traps to place throughout the level to get rid of your nemesis. Buckets of water can be set up over doors and items can be rigged with bombs. If your opponent has set a booby trap, you can defuse it with the proper item. Should you get caught in a trap, you have infinite lives, and all you lose is time. If you want a friend to join the mayhem, use a link cable and go at it. Who will be able to survive from one stage to the next in SPY VS SPY?
