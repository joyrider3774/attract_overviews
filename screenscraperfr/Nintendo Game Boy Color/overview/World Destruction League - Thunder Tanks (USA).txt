In the future the world is a very bleak place, where the major form of entertainment is the World Destruction League. The League travels throughout the world hosting competitions, in which the contestants try to blow each other to little bits while riding in tanks. You are one of the contestants, and can play as any of 12 competitors with unique tanks and weapons. Compete in 35 competitions in seven different arenas, each arena filled with buildings and other obstacles. However, you can create "short cuts" by blasting the obstacles out of the way. Throughout the game, you can use over 20 different weapons and four power-ups to destroy the competition. Will you be able to survive the competition of WORLD DESTRUCTION LEAGUE: Thunder Tanks?
