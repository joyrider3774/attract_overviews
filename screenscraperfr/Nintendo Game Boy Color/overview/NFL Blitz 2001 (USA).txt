If you're a football fanatic looking for arcade-style gridiron action, then NFL BLITZ 2001 from Midway is right up your alley. Take all the tiresome rules and regulations of standard football and throw them out the window BLITZ is fast, furious, and out of control. Real-life NFL stars are modeled here in a brutish, cartoon-inspired fashion and their burly physiques are perfect for inflicting damage on your opponents. Listen and laugh at humorous commentary from the in-game announcer and garner helpful hints from the sexy cheerleaders as you attack your way upfield towards the goal line. And you can savor all the bone-crushing pigskin mayhem again and again in a helmet-cracking replay mode. You'll watch in awe as your team catches fire after a series of excellent plays. Compete in four stadiums new to the franchise like the "Stadium of the Future," watch the action from a range of angles (including Blimp view), go head-to-head in Single-Player competition, and much more.
