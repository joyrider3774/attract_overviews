The arcade classic MISSILE COMMAND has made its way to the Game Boy Color. The concept of the game is simple: missiles come from the top of the screen, and you are trying to defend the six buildings in the city below. Your goal is to target the missiles and fire your defensive weaponry; if the cloud from your weapon touches the missile, it is destroyed. However, you only have a limited number of shots, and if all sections of the city are destroyed, it's Game Over. After successfully defending a city from two waves of missiles, you will be treated to a special animation that is related to the city. If your friends want to get in on the action, there is an alternating Two-Player mode. Try to defend the world's cities from destruction in MISSILE COMMAND.
