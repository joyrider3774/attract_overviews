Exciting NHL action comes to the Game Boy Color with ESPN NATIONAL HOCKEY NIGHT. Since the game is fully licensed by the NHL, all of the teams (including the expansion Columbus Blue Jackets and Minnesota Wild) and players are here. When you want a quick puck fix, play a single game in the Exhibition mode. True hockey fanatics will want to take all of the challenges of a full Season, but if you're not interested in hockey until it's Cup time, you can skip the season and go straight to the Playoffs. If you think you are as good as anyone in the NHL, you can even put yourself into the game with the Create-a-Player mode. Now you can literally get into the game with ESPN NATIONAL HOCKEY NIGHT.
