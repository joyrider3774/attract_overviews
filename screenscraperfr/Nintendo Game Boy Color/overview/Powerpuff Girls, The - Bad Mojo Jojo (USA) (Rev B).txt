The Powerpuff Girls make their first appearance on the Game Boy Color with POWERPUFF GIRLS: Bad Mojo Jojo. You take the role of Blossom, who is known for her intelligence. Blossom must punch and kick her way through levels filled with puzzles that need solving, and she's got to collect all of the icons in each level. Some of them are power-ups that allow Blossom to use an ice beam to temporarily freeze her enemies, while others are artwork that can be traded between the three POWERPUFF GIRLS games. Ultimately, Blossom must come face to face with her nemesis, Mojo Jojo. Will Blossom be able to save Townsville from certain doom? Find out by playing POWERPUFF GIRLS: Bad Mojo Jojo.
