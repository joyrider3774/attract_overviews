Collecting seven early to mid 1980s videogames on one CD, Namco Museum Vol. 1 includes: Pac-Man, the first-ever cute character maze game; Galaga, a Space Invaders-influenced shooter featuring a star fighter versus wave after wave of alien spaceships; Pole Position, the first car racing game where you must qualify before beginning the main race; Bosconian, an Asteroids-like shoot 'em up; Rally-X and New Rally-X, car racing maze games in which you use smoke screens to wipe out other vehicles; and Toy Pop, a game set in a whimsical world of presents and toys.
 In addition to playing the games, you can visit the museum. It features many collectible, out-of-print videogame items on display such as a Pac-Man notebook, a Pac-Man towel and a couple of Pac-Man T-shirts. Also on display are various instruction cards, top displays and screen overlays from Pac-Man and the other games in this collection. You'll also find slide shows, trivia and gaming tips in the museum.
