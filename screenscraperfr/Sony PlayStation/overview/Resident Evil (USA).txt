In Resident Evil, you play the role of either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine. Your choice of will determine various events and the flow of the storyline. After choosing your character you begin to explore the house, which is filled with all sorts of nasty creatures -- mainly zombies -- and some devious puzzles. Puzzles may involve putting a certain item in its right place, unlocking doors, and pushing statues. Each puzzle you solve brings you closer to unraveling the mystery behind the house and the Umbrella corporation.
 Among the various things you will find throughout the mansion are item boxes. Because your character can only hold a certain number of items (Chris can hold up to six items and Jill can hold eight), you will need to safely store objects you don't have room to carry. You will also come across stones that need to be placed in their corresponding cubbyholes, health and herb medication, diaries of lab technicians, weapons, and keys.
 In addition to a map and radio system, you are provided with a small arsenal of weaponry. The default weapon is a melee knife but as you progress through the game, you will also come across a 9mm handgun, a shotgun, a magnum, and explosive acid and fire rounds. But will this be enough? Can you solve the mystery of Resident Evil before its too late, or will you "disappear" like Bravo Team?
