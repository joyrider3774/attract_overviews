After hearing a rare Interplanetary Distress Call Alpha (IDCA), your team aboard the SCU-13 Galant heads slowly toward the signal, ready for trouble. In Philosoma, you lead that team through 18 environments in search of the mysterious distress call, destroying enemies and obstacles in your path.
 Go up against a variety of vehicles including the "Hover Carrier," the "Makkon," and the "Missile Walker" as you clear your way with one of four main weapons such as the Vulcan, Laser, A-Break, or Ray-B. Each weapon can be upgraded up to three times when specific power-up icons are collected. A secondary weapon such as Buster grenades, MRMs, and SRMs are equipped at the beginning of a level or acquired through a power-up.
