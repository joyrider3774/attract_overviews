This is an extremely hard action platform type game. This game is mostly similar to other Mario Bros run and jump variants we are familiar with. This game however, throws in a bit of a Castlevania type theme. You mostly travel upward and not side to side like most similar side scrolling games. This contributes to making the game more difficult than the others. It also has a added twist that you have to work your way around obstacles, lines of fire that come out the floor, and many other things. You collect keys, bombs, and other items of which I am not sure where you use them because I didn't make it that far. All in all it is a fun game, though a very challenging one.
