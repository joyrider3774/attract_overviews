Castle Quest is a strategy game loosely based on chess by Hudson Soft. It is an interesting mix of heroic fantasy and classical chess - the player must use his pieces, a move at the time, to capture the opponent's king while protecting his own. However, Castle Quest features a lot more pieces than traditional chess such as Wizards, Ninjas, Orcs, Mummies and even Dragons.

Each piece comes with a set of attributes such as Health, Magic, Defense and Attack and these lie at the center of the gameplay - unlike chess, when one piece attempts to take another they have to fight to determine who takes the square. Each fight is round based and driven by the roll of a dice (symbolized by playing cards going from 1 to 10). Some pieces can also use magic spells or special attacks - some pieces use healing powers whereas others throw fireballs or even resurrect lost pieces.
