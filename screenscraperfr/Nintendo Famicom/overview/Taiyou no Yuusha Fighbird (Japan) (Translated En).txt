Some evil dude tries to start a war by stealing all the oil. Choose between pilots Kesota or Katori to stop him in this vertical scrolling shooter. The player can switch between different vehicles during play. Tank, drill, rocket, bomber, jet. Eventually the Fire Bird mech is added to the list. Each vehicle has multiple weapons that can be switched during play. 

titled after episode 2 of the Brave series, The Brave Fighter of Sun Fighbird. The Brave series was animated by Sunrise and distributed by Nagoya TV. Apparently "Fighbird" really is the correct spelling in Japan.
