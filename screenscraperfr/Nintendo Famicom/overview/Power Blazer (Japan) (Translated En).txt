Power Blazer is an action/platform game by Taito. In the 21st century, the whole world is handled by a super-computer called the Brain Master. But one day, all systems start to inexplicably shut down at once. Humans have to accept the evidence, Brain Master has taken over the once gladdened Earth and plunged it into chaos. The player takes control of Steve Treiber, a highly trained soldier on a lone mission behind enemy lines. He is the only one capable of taking Brain Master offline and to save the world. Our young hero is armed with a powerful combat-boomerang called the 'Power Blazer'. Stages are fairly large and most of them have different routes to the finish line.
The American (and European) version of the game, called Power Blade, is significantly different than the Japanese version.
