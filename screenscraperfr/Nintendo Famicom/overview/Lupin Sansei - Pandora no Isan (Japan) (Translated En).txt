Lupin Sansei: Pandora no Isan, "Lupin the Third: Legacy of Pandora" is a video game for the Family Computer based on the popular Lupin III series by Monkey Punch and is a sequel of sorts to the film The Castle of Cagliostro. It was developed by TOSE and released by Namco under their Namcot label on November 6, 1987 in Japan only. 

The game is somewhat similar to Namco's earlier released arcade title, Rolling Thunder, with the addition of multiple gadgets and the ability to switch between the three main characters. Lupin and his allies can find other characters in each stage who can be bribed for information. The persistent Zenigata also makes an appearance, present in each stage, attempting to arrest Lupin.
