It is an exploration game which uses Jaleco's arcade game Psychic 5 as the basis for the story and the cast of characters which you use throughout the game. Each character possesses different attributes, including their jumping ability, their ability to hover in mid-air, and their strength. As in the arcade, some characters must be rescued in order to make them playable. This game boasts over 50 household items which serve as animated enemies throughout each level. The game was never sold outside of Japan, or translated from Japanese to any other language.
Akio, being a member of the Esper Corps organization which supposedly fights Evil all over the world. His task is quite simple - save his friends and somebody else from the Devil's Castle with his formidable hammer and... enormously jumpy feet... (you'll see what I mean when you play it). The game is quite lengthy and mazy at places, so do talk to strange dwellers of that place (don't be afraid to use the START button to talk).
