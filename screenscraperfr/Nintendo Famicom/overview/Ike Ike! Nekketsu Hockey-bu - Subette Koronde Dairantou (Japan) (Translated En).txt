Hey there, this is the Nekketsu High School Paper. Our own Kunio has become famous as a leader. With him we won both the dodge ball and soccer championships. They competed and won at the world stage, it is truly amazing. But did you know, Nekketsu High also has an ice hockey club? Sadly, our team is very weak... We probably won't even make the playoffs in the next national championship. Perhaps Kunio can lead our ice hockey team to victory as well. With him, would it become a successful team, or still be in the minor leagues? Passionate ice hockey spirit! Good luck everyone!
