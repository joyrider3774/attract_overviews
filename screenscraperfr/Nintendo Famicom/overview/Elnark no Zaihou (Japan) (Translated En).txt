Erunaaku No Zaihou is a simplistic arcade game played from an overhead view. The player controls a man who wants to go upriver. This man can move up, down, left and right. On his travels, he is assaulted by all kinds of enemy creatures. His means of attack is to throw sais (daggers) directly in front of him which destroy the enemies. Various power-ups are also scattered around, many of which restore life or defense.
