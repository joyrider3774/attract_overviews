You must do battle with the five members of Dr. Wit's Joke Army in order to
save the world. You can choose to fight them in any order, but they are
increasingly difficult from left to right. For the purposes of this manual, I
will refer to them as levels one through five, with one being on the left and
five being on the right. There are five rounds in each battle. The first three
are on foot (or wing, or belly, or ice skates, accordingly) and the fourth and
fifth levels are on Segways.
