One day, a mysterious theme park called Karakuri Land appeared in Edo. In it were various mechanical attractions, built around different themes. Many people went to visit, and the park was very popular. The princess asked Yanchamaru if he would like to go with her, but since he was busy with his training, she went by herself. However, she didn't come back, and so Yanchamaru must make his way through the oddly-aggressive attractions to find and rescue the princess!

Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 2 is the sequel to Kid Niki, and once again stars the big-headed, sword-spinning, headband-sporting fighter Yanchamaru. Each stage is based around a theme, such as a world built from cakes and a world built from volcanoes, and each is filled with animatronic enemies, with a boss at the end. Yanchamaru has his trusty spinning sword, and can also find bonus items to improve his abilities and increase his score.
