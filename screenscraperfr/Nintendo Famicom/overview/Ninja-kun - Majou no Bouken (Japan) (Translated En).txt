Ninja-kun is on a mission. He alone must climb the mountain and enter Demon Castle and clear out its evil inhabitants. He will face enemies along the way, and must eliminate them before he can progress to the second mountain, and on to the castle. When he succeeds, he must start over at the bottom of the mountain against a tougher group of foes.
