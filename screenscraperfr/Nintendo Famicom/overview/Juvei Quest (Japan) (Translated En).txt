Juvei Quest is a RPG which could easily compete with the heavyweights like Dragon Quest. The title contains an immense story, lovely characters, thoughtful turn-based battle system with many skills and abilities to use. the game even came packaged with a table game.
The story itself unfolds in the Age of Sengoku of Ancient Japan attacked by some demonic force called "The Demonic Horde", being quite a loose interpretation of the famous one-eyed samurai - Yagyuu Juubei, one of the most romanticized figures in Japanese history who presumably lived during the second Shogun Tokugawa's.
