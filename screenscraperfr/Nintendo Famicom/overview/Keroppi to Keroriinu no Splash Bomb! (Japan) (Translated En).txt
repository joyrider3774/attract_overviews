"Keroppi to Keroriinu no Splash Bomb!" is a pretty fun Bomberman-ish game, with a nice free roaming aspect to the levels, meaning you have to find your way through the levels to get to the boss, unlike most Bomberman games where each level is primarily one screen.  It also features a very original story line.. little white thingy, who is revealed as Teruteru Chan in the ending, is bopping around to *gasp* be kidnapped!  So... being the heroes that Keroppi & Keroleen are, they set off, armed with water balloons to rescue Teruteru Chan.
Two player mode features simultaneous play, which can work to your advantage in single player mode.
