Grand Master is an action RPG, featuring a cool intro, neat music, and most importantly: a hero with a sword so high you can't get over it, so low you can't get under it, and so wide you can't get around it.
The game itself plays from a top-down perspective, a bit like The Legend of Zelda, but with some extra RPG elements added in. It features a basic leveling system that maxes out at 10 and basic HP and MP stats that increase by 10 each level up until they reach 99. The stages are also in the same vein as The Legend of Zelda in regards to the dungeons, albeit in a much simpler form. Instead of an overworld, you instead pick from five stages on a world map and each stage follows the same basic formula that consists of finding the key to open the door to the boss. Each stage contains various enemies that respawn, the occasional warp point, and a handful of chests that contain a new weapon, accessory and healing items. The final stage also follows the same pattern, but it's about five stages combined into one and borders on torture/redundancy with a series of mazes and long passageways that take forever to pass. It is at odds with the first five stages.
The game makes use of a branching path system that's based on the order in which you clear all the stages. If certain events are not triggered, you will get a bad ending. The optimal order is as follows:Castle, Ice Temple, Cave, Pyramid, Tower. If you enter the Tower before the Cave level, you will
get the bad ending.If you enter the Pyramid before the Cave level, you will get an alternate story branch.
