One day, Emmy was taking care of her gashapon machine (those claw prize machines), when she and her machine were abducted by the evil Dark Brain. However, the gashapons of the legendary heroes Ultraman, Gundam, Shaider and Kamen Rider, were freed from the machine. Now the heroes have to rescue Emmy from Dark Brain.
this is the same Emmy from the Great Battle and Super Robot Wars OG series.
