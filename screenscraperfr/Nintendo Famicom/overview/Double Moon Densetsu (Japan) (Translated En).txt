The world of sword and magic, Double Moon, with its two continents - Northern and Southern - was created by the benevolent deity Fatima. However, the evil demon Samoirenko plans to destroy this world by summoning the mysterious dark Dragon. You take control of a young boy named Yuuru, whose father was abducted by Samoirenko long time ago. You discover that you also had a twin sister who has disappeared. Now you feel ready to find your father and to confront Samoirenko - you leave your home village and begin a dangerous journey, during which you'll meet many friends and many foes.

This game is a traditional console-style RPG. Yuuru and his friends travel on the continents of Double Moon, visiting towns, castles, and dungeons, and fighting monsters in turn-based battles viewed from first person perspective.
