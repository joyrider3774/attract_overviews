The sequel to the arcade game "Dragon Buster" has the following background story: you are a young archer Carl, who has to retrieve an ancient artifact in order to liberate the world from the domination of demons and dragons. 

Unlike the first game, you are not restricted to a platform here, but can move freely to any direction. You have to go through the maze-like dungeons, find a key, and then get to the exit. After that, the dungeon disappears and makes it possible for you to progress to the next one. You fight enemies with your bow. You have a limited supply of arrows, but you can find quivers among other items in the dungeons.
