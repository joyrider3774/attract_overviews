Bazaru de Gozaru no Game de Gozaru is a puzzle game starring a monkey protagonist named Bazaru. The concept of the game is remotely similar to that of Lemmings: the player's task is to "program" the actions of the hero in order to safely traverse a stage full of traps and hazards. Unlike Lemmings, there is only one primate to control in this game; also, the player's "programming" must be performed before letting the monkey loose, unlike the real-time player input in Lemmings.

The player basically orders the monkey what to do at specific spots (which are highlighted by exclamation marks on the level map). In the beginning the levels are short and simple, and the monkey can perform only one action. As the game advances, the puzzles become more and more complex, and so is the amount of actions the monkey must perform to reach safety.
