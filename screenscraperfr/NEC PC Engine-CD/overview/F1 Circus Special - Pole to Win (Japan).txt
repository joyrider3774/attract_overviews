F1 Circus Special is a Formula 1 racing game. Players can choose between a world championship mode, which follows the path of one driver through the game's available courses in a linear fashion; a test drive mode, which allows players to choose any course as well as change rules and conditions (e.g. the amount of damage inflicted); and a time attack mode for competing against each other.
