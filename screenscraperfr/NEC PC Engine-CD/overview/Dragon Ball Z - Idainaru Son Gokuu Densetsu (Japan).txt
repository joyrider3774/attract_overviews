Idainaru Son Goku Densetsu features Gohan telling Goten of the battles of their deceased father, Goku, along with other characters. The game illustrates Goku's seven greatest battles: fighting Mercenary Tao, challenging Tien Shinhan at the World Martial Arts Tournament, destroying King Piccolo, fighting Piccolo at the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament, protecting Earth from Vegeta, saving Namek from Frieza, and sacrificing his life to save the world from Perfect Cell.

The game does not let the player completely control Goku, instead choosing whether he is on the offense, defense, powering up, or running. There are also cutscenes that may happen in the middle of battle, triggered by certain actions from the series, such as Goku breaking Tao's sword with the Power Pole.
