The game resembles R-Type, particularly in art style and gameplay. The plot and setting uses the same trope as games like R-Type and Gradius; it concerns an ongoing war between mankind and a race of invading aliens belonging to the Zoul Empire, and the player's primary enemy consists of bioships and enormous organic fortresses.
