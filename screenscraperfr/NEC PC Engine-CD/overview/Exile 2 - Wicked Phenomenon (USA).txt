The world of Chaltar is at stake and Sadler returns as the main protagonist and titular character of the series. Nearly, as his first task is to look for his friends in the nearby towns. Unlike the previous episodes of the series, Sadler is here one of several possible playable characters - the cute but lethal Rumi, the strong Kindi and the mystic Fakhyle follow our hero in his quest and can be controlled. The game follows the same formula laid out by its predecessors and alternates between fighting and exploring. The first part gets Sadler to walk around towns, talk to villagers or purchase new equipment. The fighting phases are classic hack-and-slash action scenes set in countless hostile locations - there the player fight enemies, bosses and earn precious experience points and gold coins.
