Download 2 is an horizontal shooter. Nec Avenue certainly acknowledged that the game's best asset was the unique and innovative ability to jack-in and dive into computerized cyber-space worlds. This sequel follows the same formula but also features probably one of most electrifying storyline ever written for a video game. The brain of Adolf Hitler has been digitized inside a computer mainframe by terrorists and Syd, an elite cyber-diver and protagonist of the game, embarks on a perilous journey to stop and destroy the incoming threat. On board his ship and helped by the cute Deva, Syd flies through nine enemy infested areas and dives into abstract and challenging cyber worlds. Four different weapons are available to him at the press of a button - multiway Vulcan-gun, wide laser-beams, spread homing-lasers and a short-range lightning gun. Each weapon can be powered-up a grand total of three times by collecting "P" pods that appear on the screen whereas "S" pods increase the overall speed of the ship. Other special items are available throughout the game such as smart-bombs and protective shields.
