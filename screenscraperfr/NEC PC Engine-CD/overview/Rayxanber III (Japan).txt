Rayxanber II sequel. Absolutely everything has been reviewed for the better, while simultaneously staying true to the style of the previous two games. To start, someone finally fixed the mechanics of the board, so now it really works and is easily controlled. As before, there is a temperature bar, so if it turns red it must cool down before running again, but now it is much easier to regulate the duration of your run without resorting to a turbo button. The level structure and the attack patterns of the enemy are also much more balanced to take into account the use of the board: you are no longer forced to throw yourself headlong into a phalanx of enemies because something is chasing your tail. It has legitimately become a useful tool in your arsenal.
