Megumi Rescue puts you in the shoes of a rescue team, trying to save the inhabitants of the burning buildings. You control two stretchers carrying a canvas that makes a fireman jump and bounce, catch the victims, or extinguish the fire from the windows. The goal is to rescue the people in danger, or extinguish all the flames of the building.
