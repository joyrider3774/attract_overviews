In this game you play the role of a lone soldier much like Rambo. Your main objectives are to free prisoners of war whilst fighting of enemy soldiers. The gameplay involves you viewing the action from a top down perspective and battling your way up the screen. You have 2 weapons at your disposal. A machine gun which has unlimited ammunition and a bow which fires explosive warheads. 
The enemies re spawn so you have to keep battling upwards as staying in the same place for to long means you get surrounded by the enemy. Freeing prisoners involves you blowing up the huts they are in with your bow and you are awarded with more arrows for doing this. The game also offers 2 players to fight alongside one another for twice the fire power.
