The Pro Yakyuu Pennant Race is a baseball game for the Sega Master System. The game was an upgrade of Great Baseball, a title that was not released in Japan.

The game underwent significant changes, such as localization of players and teams for the Japanese market along with adding new game modes, a more detailed interface and featuring a bird's-eye view when fielding as opposed to Great Baseball's isometric view.
