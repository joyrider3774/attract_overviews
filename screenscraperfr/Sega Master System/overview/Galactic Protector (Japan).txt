As a ship that looks like the one in the Fantasy Zone series you must protect three planets from floating space debris by using your built-in laser shots to destroy them. If you fail to shoot at them quickly, the debris will eventually come in contact with it. If this happens, 10% of the planet's life will be lost. Once you have destroyed enough debris, you receive a bonus for how much planet life that remains and move on to the next round. Later in the game, you will receive a 3-way shot as well as protection that will greatly help you in further rounds. The game ends when you lose all your lives or the planet blows up. 25 rounds.
