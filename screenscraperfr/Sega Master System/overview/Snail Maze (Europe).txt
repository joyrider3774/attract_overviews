Snail Maze is a hidden Sega Master System game, which is available in the BIOS screen of any original model Master System console. It is accessed by holding 1, 2 and Up at the Sega logo, assuming you do not have a cartridge inserted.

The feature was removed in the later Master System II models, as well as models which include either Sonic the Hedgehog or Alex Kidd in Miracle World built in.
