Chefinho is sick, and to be cured he'll need a medicine made up from six rare herbs. But they can only be found in the wilds, and get them is a mission for Gilmar and Priscila.

As Aventuras da TV Colosso (which means "The Adventures of TV Colosso") is a modified version of Astérix and the Secret Mission, with Astérix and Obelix replaced by Gilmar and Priscila, characters from a Brazilian TV puppet show, popular during the early 90's.

In this side-scrolling action game, the player can choose to play either Gilmar or Priscila at the start of each one of the six levels. Although the main setting of each level is the same to both characters (forests, caves, deserts, underwater stages, waterfalls and such) the level design for each one may vary. In two player mode, players will take turns playing as Gilmar and Priscila. Both characters jump (by pressing button 2), punch enemies and break blocks (by pressing button 1). Gilmar can run can run (by pressing and holding button 1 while moving) and double jump (by pressing 2 in the middle of a jump). Priscila is stronger and can break several bricks in a row when jumping over them (pressing 1 while jumping), and can also slide down hills (by pressing down at them).

Gilmar can get some potions (thrown by pressing up and 1), which can break rocks, kill or shrink enemies. Priscila can get miniature menhirs which can be thrown (by pressing up and 1) against enemies. Both characters can also get bones throughout the game, granting access to bonus stages where the player controls a little dog. Some levels also involve minor puzzle solving, like pushing switches or moving rock blocks.
