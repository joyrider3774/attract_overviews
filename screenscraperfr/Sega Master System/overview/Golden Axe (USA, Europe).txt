Sega's classic arcade beat-'em-up game, Golden Axe puts in the shoes of one barbarian trying to overthrow the evil rule of Death-Adder, who - along with his forces of darkness - kidnapped and imprisoned the King and his daughter and stole the legendary Golden Axe.

This is a horizontal fighting game, where you bash everything which stands between you and Death Adder himself. The dwarf and the amazon are missing on this port but their magic remains as you can choose at the beginning of the game.
