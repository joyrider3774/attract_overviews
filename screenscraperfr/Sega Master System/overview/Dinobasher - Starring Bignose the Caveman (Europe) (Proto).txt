Join Bignose in a zany, prehistoric race to catch his dinner! Club you way through hoards of dinosaurs across four huge islands, colleciting bones and rocks and trade with the natives. Fly between the islands using your club as helicopter rotors and become the first flying man! Great cartoon graphics, brilliant music and, most importantly, excellent fun!

Unreleased although prototype is available.
