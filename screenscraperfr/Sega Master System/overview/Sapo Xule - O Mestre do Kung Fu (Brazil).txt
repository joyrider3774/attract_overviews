A kung fu gang, following the lead of the mighty sorcerer Naja (who's called that way for its hypnosis skills) wants to take over the Japanese country. Naja hypnotized an army of fighters, witches, zombies and even toads to fight for him. But he didn't know that among the toads he hypnotized was Sapo Chi-Ling, a great kung fu fighter, Sapo Xulé's master. Once Sapo Xulé knew it, he left the swamp and went to Japan to fight Naja and his gang, and free his master.

Sapo Xulé: O Mestre do Kung Fu (which means Sapo Xulé: the Master of Kung Fu) is a modified version of Kung Fu Kid, with its main character replaced by Sapo Xulé, a character based on a popular toy in Brazil back in the 80's: a toad with shoes which, when taken off, release a really bad smell.

In this side-scrolling/platform game, Sapo Xulé will fight his enemies kicking (button 1) and jumping (button 2) along seven rounds, fighting a boss at the end of each round, except for round six, which has several bosses to fight. From time to time shurikens will appear; by shooting them (pressing up and button 1), Sapo Xulé can clear the way in front of him. Some enemies will try to hold Sapo Xulé: to release himself he'll have to move fast.

All rounds have a 99 seconds time limit. Sapo Xulé starts with 3 lives and no continues.
