This game is a homebrew, an attempt to port the classic "bruce lee" on atari 800/ commodore 64 and spectrum for the master system. nnBruce Lee is a hybrid Beat 'em up/platform game, in which the player controls Bruce Lee. To progress, the player must collect a number of lanterns suspended at different points in the game. Each room is guarded by two mobile enemies, The Ninja and the Green Yamo, who attack with fists and kicks. A multiplayer mode allows a second player to control the Yamo, or allows two players in turn to control Bruce Lee. Ninja and Yamo are also vulnerable to the dangers of the screen, but have an infinite number of lives.
