Imagine Rock Star allows players to create a rock band and select who plays the drums, guitar, bass, and piano. Each instrument has its own unique control using the Nintendo DS stylus. Players have the ability to customize the look of each bandmate in order to become the most stylish rockers. Players can wirelessly jam with up to four of their friends, perform in concerts, and earn money as the band works its way up the charts to the No. 1 spot to land its dream recording contract.
