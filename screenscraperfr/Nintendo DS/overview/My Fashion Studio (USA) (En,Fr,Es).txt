My Fashion Studio will place players in the role of a young woman starting her career in the fashion industry. Players will start as an intern and ultimately open their own fashion studio. By customizing their own designs, tailoring their creations, and choosing their own models, players will eventually be able to see their designs in magazines, catalogues, and on the catwalk.
