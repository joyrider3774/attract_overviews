Rock Band 3 for Nintendo DS and DSi is the second release in the iconic Rock Band video game series for play on the Nintendo DS. Like the earlier, LEGO Rock Band, Rock Band 3 challenges DS players to take their Rock & Roll fantasies in hand, playing in a band scenario both in single player and multiplayer modes. Unlike other music simulation games developed for the DS, Rock Band 3 does not require an additional peripheral, instead utilizing DS touchscreen technology to bring addictive Rock Band Note Highway gameplay to life. The game features a series of exciting play modes, an engaging track list and 4-player multi-card support via a Nintendo WI-Fi connection.
