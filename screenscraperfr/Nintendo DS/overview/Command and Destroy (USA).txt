Command and Destroy is a war strategy game, set in the future on a colonial outpost in deep space where there are two different species pitted against one another due to Alien invasion. Players can choose to be the leader of either species (Human or Alien) and will gradually complete all missions, with the ultimate aim being total annihilation of the opponent's armies.
