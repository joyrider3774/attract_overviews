As they are guided through each storybook, players will also express themselves with games like the sticker-book activity mode and musical tune-up activities - all of which incorporate the classic tales of Ariel from The Little Mermaid; Belle from Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Jasmine from Aladdin, Tiana from The Princess and the Frog and, appearing as a Disney Princess for the first time in a video game, Rapunzel from Tangled.nnDisney Princess: Enchanting Storybooks also features six unlockable magical tools that add to players' creativity through the game, including Belle's Rose Petal Crayon and Rapunzel's Watercolor Brush. Throughout the experience, players will be challenged by "tilt-a-maze" games along with additional musical features that include follow-the-rhythm, magic search and spot-the-difference games.
