Nintendo takes to the greens in True Swing Golf, utilizing the touch screen in providing a unique take on the sport. 

Select and customize your character, then take them down the 15 available courses. Each course bases itself on the real life sport, providing all the weather conditions, traps and long fairways you'd normally expect. The stylus will control your characters' swing, whether it be driving, putting or hacking your way out of a sandtrap or the dreaded 'dead zones'.
