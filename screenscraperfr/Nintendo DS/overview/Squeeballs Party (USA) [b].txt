Squeeballs are small creatures manufactured on a secret island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. Before they can be sold to children as toys around the world, Squeeballs must be fully testedâ€¦to the point of destruction. That's where the player comes in. They blow up, slice, smack, punch, bowl, shoot and skim the Squeeballs through 6 main game challenges.
