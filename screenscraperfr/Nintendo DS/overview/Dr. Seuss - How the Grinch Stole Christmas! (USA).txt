Christmas is coming to the whimsical town of Whoville, but the grouchy old Grinch is determined to stop it. Players will take on the role of The Grinch, slyly sneaking their way past the citizens of Whoville to pilfer packages and rid the town of any holiday joy. Featuring fun-filled platform and puzzle-based gameplay, as well as vibrant locations and characters from the enormously popular feature film, the game will challenge players of all ages while reminding them that there's more to Christmas than just decorations and presents.
