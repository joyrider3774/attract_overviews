The Hidden Object Show: Season 2 is a hidden object game with a TV show theme. As a contestant in a game show, the player has to click on the assorted paraphernalia concealed in the scenery, finding the ones from a list of required objects at the bottom of the screen within a time limit.

After finishing each screen, a fortune teller appears that randomly selects one of the 11 bonus games with his crystal ball. They include common variations of the seek-and-find gameplay, like marking the differences between two similar scenes, and finding objects by their silhouettes. There are some unique games: one called Letter Getter, where the letters for the list must be collected to complete the name of the objects; and Find 10, where a riddle describes ten objects sharing the same characteristics the must be clicked.
