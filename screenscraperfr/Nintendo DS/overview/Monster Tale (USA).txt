Based on the DreamWorks 3D feature film, Monsters vs. Aliens puts the fate of the planet in players' hands, to save the world as only a monster can. Bash, skate, and ooze as the macho half-ape, half-fish The Missing Link, the 49'11" tall woman, Ginormica, and the gelatinous, indestructible, and brainless B.O.B, with the help of the monstrous 350' tall grub Insectosaurus. Plus, team up with the brilliant but insect-headed Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D. in co-op mode, to save the earth from the megalomaniacal alien Gallaxhar. Unleash unique powers as all your favorite monsters from the film - The Missing Link: Bash, bounce, swing, tail whip, and climb as this prehistoric brawler!
