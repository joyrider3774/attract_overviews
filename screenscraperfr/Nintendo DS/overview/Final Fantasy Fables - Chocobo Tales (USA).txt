Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo Tales combines the field exploration of an RPG, with card-based battles. You are free to move about through the game's picture book influenced world. Encounter an enemy, and you find yourself in a card battle, referred to officially as a "Pop-Up Duel." You and your enemies take turns sending out cards to perform attacks.
