Double Trouble is a standard side-scrolling beat-em-up in the vein of earlier entries in the Viewtiful Joe series. As with earlier entries in the series, Double Trouble sets itself apart from other games in the genre with the inclusion of VFX powers. The VFX powers in this game include:

Slow - Joe's signature VFX move, this allows him to slow down time to effectively dodge and counter enemy attacks.
Scratch - Shake things up and drop items on enemies, or just shake them until they're dizzy.
Split - Alter your environment by cutting a new path yourself.
Slide - Get a closeup view of the action and add a little extra power to Joe's hits.
