A giant hurricane has drawn thousands of fish from the ocean and scattered them all over Earth. In response to this huge environmental disaster, water tanks have been created around the world in order to help send all the fish back to sea. The goal of each level is to help a specific number of fish to reach their natural habitat and back to safety. Players will make use of numerous tools that allow interaction with the environment and to guide the water's flow in which the fish are carried.
