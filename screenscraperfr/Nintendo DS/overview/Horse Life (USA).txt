Horse Life immerses players in the equestrian world by putting a horse right inside of their DS. Using the touch screen and microphone players must keep their horse happy and fit by feeding them, cleaning their stall and riding them. Most importantly, players put their training to the test by participating in national and international competitions to earn prestige and money to become a great champion.
