In Tony Hawk’s Downhill Jam, Tony travels to 6 far away locations to challenge each venue’s top downhill racer in a quest to add them to the team. The goal is to make it to the bottom of the hill with the best time! You will also be asked to complete other challenges as well.

The player can trick and combo like any other Tony hawk game while racing down the high at high speeds, all wrapped in detailed cell shaded graphics. The player can also use the touch screen to perform special moves and to see a map of the course.

The user has a vast array of options to create their own male or female skater. Users can also create their own board logos, graffiti tags and record their voice to play back during the game.

The DS version supports up to 4-player Wi-Fi internet and local wireless play. There are over 20 online game modes to choose from. The game also supports voice chat with people on your friends list. This game also has a community website (ds.downhill-jam.com) where users can upload their high scores, bests runs and chat with other skaters.
