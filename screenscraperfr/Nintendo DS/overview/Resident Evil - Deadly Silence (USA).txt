Resident Evil: Deadly Silence brings the original PlayStation survival horror game, Resident Evil, to your Nintendo DS. You can play through the original game or in rebirth mode. Rebirth mode is essentially the same story but with new puzzles, monster placements, and touch-screen-specific minigames. You can also partake in a multiplayer match that challenges you and your opponents to complete a stretch of the game not only with the fastest time, but also with the most points, which are earned by killing enemies along the way.
