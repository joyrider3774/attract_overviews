Dual Sympathy is a side-scrolling action game that sees players take the role Edward Elric as he battles Homunculi and sets out on a quest to retrieve the Philosopher's Stone. The six playable characters in the game will have the ability to concoct weapons from various items (hence, the alchemy) and turn them on enemies. The DS version also features voice work from the actors in the television series, unlockable content, and 10 touch-screen-based minigames.
