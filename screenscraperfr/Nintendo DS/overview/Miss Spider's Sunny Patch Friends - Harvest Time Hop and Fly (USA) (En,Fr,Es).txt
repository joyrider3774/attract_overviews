The miniature wonderland of Sunny Patch is filled with bugs of all shapes, sizes and colors. Near the end of autumn they have to stock up for winter, but the kids Dragon, Bounce, Squirt, Wiggle and Shimmer need your help collecting fruit and berries. Use their unique skills to avoid obstacles along the way. The game takes full advantage of the newest Nintendo DS abilities!
