Fossil Fighters invites players to enter a world in which fearsome creatures are hidden as fossils for players to collect, using the unique touch-screen controls of Nintendo DS. Players can clean, collect and battle their discoveries. The game features more than 100 dinosaur-like creatures called Vivosaurs, each of which can be revived and deployed in strategic turn-based battles. With fun tactical elements, vast environments to explore and a lighthearted storyline and characters, Fossil Fighters allows players to control and customize a team of Vivosaurs as they battle their way through the mysterious Vivosaur Island. Players can also connect over local wireless with friends to battle customized teams of Vivosaurs or trade their fossils.
