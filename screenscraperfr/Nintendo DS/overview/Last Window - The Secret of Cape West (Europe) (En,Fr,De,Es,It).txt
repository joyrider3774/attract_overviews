1980: Kyle Hyde wakes up in his car and speaks on the phone with Ed Vincent, his boss at Red Crown; Vincent fires Hyde for his negligence. He travels to the Cape West Apartments, where he lives. Just before he enters the building, he notices a mysterious woman wearing a hat and sunglasses. Soon afterwards, he discovers that the Cape West Apartments are to be demolished at the end of the month, and all the tenants are vacating. As he opens his apartment door, he notices a letter that tells him to find out what secrets the apartments hold, and an object known as the "Scarlet Star." Thus begins Last Window: The Secret of Cape West.
