You play as the heroic Storm who must put an end to an evil organisation called Rattlesnake. Of course, you get to do this with a range of heavy weaponry and Lexicon assures us there are plenty of different weapons and pick-ups - each with its own attack method and power. Plus, some guns can be used to find secret items.
