Players care for a variety of all-new baby animals ranging from puppies to polar bear cubs and even penguins! Take care of all your baby petz and help them grow. As newborns, your baby petz will need to be fed a bottle, picked up and played with, and eventually taught to crawl. When night comes, help them fall asleep by rocking them or singing them a lullaby. Also, for the first time, take care of two animals at the same time, watch them play together, react to one another and even try to eat each other's food! From newborns to babies, these cute animals will surprise players with their clumsy and funny personalities.
