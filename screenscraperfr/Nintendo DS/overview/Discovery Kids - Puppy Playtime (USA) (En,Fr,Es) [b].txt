In Puppy Playtime, players raise and train their very own rescue dogs to eventually take on more than 30 missions alongside the Police Force, Fire Department and Lifeguards. Three of the most popular rescue dog breeds are featured in the game, including the Dalmatian, German Shepherd and beloved Labrador Retriever. Players train their puppies from two months to one year old through a series of 20 mini-games, helping them become the best rescue dogs they can be!
