Blonde teenage girl Sunny from So Blonde is back. Back to the Island tells an alternate storyline proposing the spoiled brat was washed up at the dark side of pirate infested Forgotten Island instead of the friendly shore she started at in the original game. Though the plot around the mysterious curse persists and a lot of incidents are quite the same, the story develops in a different way and reveals new characters.

The classic adventure stays true to its predecessor featuring lots of inventory- or environment-based item puzzles and optional mini-games.
