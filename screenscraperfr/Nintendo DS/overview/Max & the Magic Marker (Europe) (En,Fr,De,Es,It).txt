Max & the Magic Marker will be familiar to fans of platform games but provides a unique twist that allows the player's imagination to literally run wild. The player must use the magic marker to solve puzzles, overcome obstacles, and defeat enemies. Along the way you must collect ink in order to continue drawing. On the Wii, the player will use the nunchuk for player movement while the remote controls your marker. At any point the player can pause the action to draw their way out of sticky situations. Max, the game's hero, is a young boy who loves to draw. One day he receives a mysterious orange marker in the mail. As he begins drawing with the mysterious marker he quickly notices it has magical powers. Anything Max draws starts moving on the paper and comes to life. The monster he draws begins messing around with Max's artwork and so Max decides to draw himself into his picture and that is where the adventure begins.
