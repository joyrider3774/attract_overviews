Dino Master: Dig Discover Duel thrusts you into the role of Dave the Digger on his hunt for the biggest and best dinosaur fossils around the globe. Capturing these fossils won't be easy - avoid the giant insects and other nasties, before they surround your dig site. Once you've excavated your finds, bring them back to the laboratory to rebuild them. After they've been rebuilt, you'll pit dino against dino in Battle Mode.
