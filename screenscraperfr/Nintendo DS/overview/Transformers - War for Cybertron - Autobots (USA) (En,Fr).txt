Taking place on the Transformers home planet of Cybertron, Transformers: The War for Cybertron tells the story of the Transformers long before they came in contact with Earth, an event that had been previously explored in the games based on the 2007 and 2009 movies. In Transformers: War for Cybertron - Autobots players can play their favorite Decepticon characters and fight as the ultimate weapon, transforming at any time between vehicle and robot and hitting enemies with futuristic firepower.

Like the console version there are linear campaign of missions, following basically the same story. There is an Arena mode with five "arenas", each with six missions available, four bonus levels from the opposing game, and seven multiplayer levels.

There are two DS versions of the game, this and the Decepticons version. To unlock all 30 total playable Transformers, including 11 DS-exclusives, players need to defeat friends in head-to-head multi-player to win their characters.
