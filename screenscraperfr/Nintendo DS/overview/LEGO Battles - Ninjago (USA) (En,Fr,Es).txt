Produced by critically acclaimed TT Games and developed by Hellbent Games, LEGO Battles: Ninjago allows players to become a master of Spinjitzu, an art form in which characters spin and become tornadoes to defeat their enemies, as they restore harmony to the world. Players can choose to play both "good" and "evil" single-player campaigns, test their skills in a variety of Battle Mode challenges, or play with family and friends in exciting multiplayer showdowns.
