LOL is the ultimate party game that allows players' imaginations to run free. Since LOL has no rules, there's nothing to limit a player's creativity. The game's concept is simple; the host thinks up a challenge for the other players and then everyone battles it out by drawing, picking, or writing the best answer. When everyone has finished and submitted their answers, voting begins. The one with the most votes wins! Remember, if the game is boring, then you are boring!
