Like the show, the game focuses on the adventures of Alex, Max, and Justin Russo, teenage siblings who happen to be wizards. The game is split into several smaller episodes that end up tying into a larger plot involving a magical dress that Alex is making for a wizardry fashion show.

Gameplay is a mix of point-and-click adventure game and action, with a heavier emphasis on the adventure aspects. In each episode, the kids learn a new spell, which is then used to solve a series of area-based puzzles. For example, early in the game Alex needs to break out of class in order to get a look at an off-limits globe showing her dress's location.
