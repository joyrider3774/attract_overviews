Toon-Doku is a sudoku game for Nintendo DS which attempts to substitute the numbers used in the original game for colorful images.
The game features 99 custom sudoku puzzles widely ranging in difficulty, 9 different avatars, and 246 different images to substitute the numbers with. The game is fully customizable, allowing the player to choose not only his or her own avatar, but the background skin, music tracks, as well as all 9 of the symbols used to play the game (the game doesn't force the player to use images, one can choose to use numbers). Furthermore, the player is given a choice to draw his/her own unique set of symbols.
