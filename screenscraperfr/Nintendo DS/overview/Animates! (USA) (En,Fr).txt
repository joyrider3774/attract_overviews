My Little Flufties is a 3D life simulator in the line of Tamagochi. Aimed at children aged 5-9, gamers can choose between 5 imaginary creatures. You must nourish, wash, educate and amuse the creatures to keep the game going.

The fairy-like 3D world contains several attractions like swings and slides. Next to that, there are also 5 mini-games available in the game:

1. Mole-o-matic: jump on the head of the moles to stun them.
2. Shoot the balloons: shoot with a peashooter to pop coloured balloons.
3. Fish-o-matic: catch fish with a fishing net.
4. Hopscotch: jump on the good squares to advance.
5. Find the Tweet-Tweet: find 4 birds hidden in the game's world.

The game uses a full 3D engine but with a traditional drawing style, similar to Okami.
