Big Bucks, No Whammys! The cult classic game show makes its video game debut on the Wii, DS, and PC/Mac. Contestants collect "spins" by answering trivia questions, and then use their "spins" on an 18-space game board full of cash and prizes. The person who amasses the most in cash and prizes at the end of the game wins. Watch out for those famous Whammies along the way, they will steal all of your cash and prizes.
