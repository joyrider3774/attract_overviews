Aliens have taken over the World Wide Web! Players are challenged to solve different types of puzzles by flicking, dragging, and tapping the screen using the stylus. These puzzles require quick reactions and pattern matching. Players can play through the story mode, where they try to stop the alien attack by playing these puzzles against various bosses. They can also play with a friend using Download Play, which allows them to play wirelessly with just one game cartridge. Endless mode allows a player to pick a specific puzzle game mode and try to survive as long as he can.
