Classical dance is one of the most popular hobbies among girls. Ballet tells a story, expressed through music and dance instead of words. In this new simulation for Wii and Nintendo DS, players take on the role of a 12-year-old girl, who has just been admitted to a very prestigious dancing academy. During her period of training, the heroine commits herself solely to dancing. Her dream is to become a great prima ballerina. But the path to success is full of challenges.
