Just like the show Pet Alien, the game chronicles a pre-adolescent Earthling named Tommy Cadle, whose life is turned upside down after the arrival of his new alien friends, Gumpers, Dinko, Swanky, Flip and Scruffy. When Tommy is kidnapped by the evil Robotix, Gumpers and friends have to battle through space using their unique alien agility, brains, brawn and speed to rescue their human friend.
