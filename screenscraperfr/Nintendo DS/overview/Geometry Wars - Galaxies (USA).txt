First acting as a bonus mini-game in Project Gotham Racing 2 on Xbox, Geometry Wars Galaxies is now a game in its own right on DS. On board your spacecraft, you have to face the hordes of geometric enemies that are constantly sweeping the playground. Old-fashioned shoot'em up, Geometry Wars Galaxies is a demanding title not to be put among all hands.
