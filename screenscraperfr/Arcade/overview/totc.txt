Treasure of the Caribbean is a puzzle game: you must combine three ghosts or more of the same color. The number of combined ghosts above three are sent to the opponent in the form of graves. Of course, these can in turn be returned if they are close to a combination of three colored ghosts. Of course, the speed also increases but not enough to make the game impossible as a Puyo Puyo or Tetris for example.
