In The Tin Star, a single-screen shooting game, hero Zeke rides into town to protect the law-abiding citizens from bandits & varmits.

From a shoot-out in the street, to an ambush in the saloon, to a corral brawl, to the bonus round in the open desert where lonesome lawman Zeke can double his score by shooting an hombre from his horse.

The Tin Star is a tricky shooter where you have to dodge and shoot sideways and upward to clear multiple screens of bad guys.
