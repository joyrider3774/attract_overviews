You sit at the controls of an advanced battletank, looking out on the battlefield of the future. 

Your mission is to seek out and destroy all enemy forces operating on the asteroid you have been assigned to defend. Your own tank is equipped with a defensive shield and two kinds of weapon. Firstly you have a conventional cannon, firing high velocity armour piercing shells. In addition to these, you may fire wire guided anti-tank missiles. When fired, these are controlled by use of the left and right keys.
