Flashback, known in the US as Flashback: The Quest for Identity, is arguably Delphine Software's greatest work. CD-based versions tend to include full motion video cutscenes and an enhanced music soundtrack, but are essentially the same game. 

The year is 2142. You play as Conrad B. Hart, a man who has lost his memory. After barely escaping from hostile aliens, Conrad's bike crashes on an unknown planet. Conrad finds himself in the jungle, and from now on his quest for survival.
