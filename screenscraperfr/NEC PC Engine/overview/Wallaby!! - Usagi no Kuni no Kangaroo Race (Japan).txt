Wallaby!! is a racing simulation game from Tenky and Masaya. It plays similarly to a number of horse racing simulators for Japanese systems, but switches the horses for kangaroos and wallabies and human riders for rabbits. The player selects a rabbit as their protagonist and can either raise marsupials for racing or simply bet on those belonging to other rabbits.

As was the case for the majority of Japanese horse racing games, it did not see an international release.
