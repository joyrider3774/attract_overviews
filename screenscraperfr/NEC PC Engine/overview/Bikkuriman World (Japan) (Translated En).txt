One of the first games that used the CD-ROM format (and also one of the first ones that featured voice acting), Bikkuriman Daijikai is a quiz game dedicated entirely to the popular  Bikkuriman franchise, which originated with stickers on chocolate bars, and later evolved into collectible card game, manga and anime series.

The game's structure mimics collection of Bikkuriman stickers. The original stickers had different values; the bizarre Bikkuriman characters were divided into three classes (Angels, Protectors, and Demons), and the highest-rated (and rarest) stickers were the so-called "Heads", mostly bearing names from various mythologies and religions ("Super Zeus", "Maria", etc.). In the game, the player can view a number of the more "ordinary" stickers; the "head" is available only after having answered a trivia question correctly. 

Each "head" unlocks a map part of the Bikkuriman world; each part, in its turn, unlocks a series of short non-interactive scenes from the anime, accompanied by narration.
