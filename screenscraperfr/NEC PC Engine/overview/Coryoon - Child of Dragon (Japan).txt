Horizontal shoot 'em up that casts you as a baby dragon out to free a princess from the clutches of an evil....well, you get the idea. Gameplay is traditional, with power-up weapons that include multi-way shot and 'miniature' mode and a sort of reverse R-Type beam where you don't shoot to power it up. Also contains 2 minute and 5 minute time attack modes.
