Kickball is a comedic sports game developed by Dual and published by Masaya exclusively for the Japanese PC Engine. It resembles baseball, complete with a diamond of bases to around, but the "batting" player is actually kicking the ball. The rest of the game plays like a normal round of baseball.

It features seven characters - each of which represents a team of identical athletes - each with their own special pitch/kick move. These characters also include the two protagonists from the Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman series: Tasuke and Kyapiko (or Arnold and Sonia, as they're known in Shockman). Each team also has an assigned stadium that fits their theme: the seal team, for instance, have a stadium with an ice-like floor.
