Unlicensed PC Engine release by Games Express. AV Poker is not a full poker simulator, but a simple gambling game. You choose from Normal, which is a standard game or Special Mode, where you travel around the world to show off your gambling skills. The poker part of the game is extremely simple. You place a bet, get a hand dealt to you, choose which cards to hold, and get a second deal to fill in the discards. If you match any of the standard poker hands, you win. You then get the options of taking the cash or playing a higher-lower game to increase your winnings significantly. Occasionally, you also get a fruit machine style mini-game which gives you the chance of winning 'special' cards that can be used during the game.
