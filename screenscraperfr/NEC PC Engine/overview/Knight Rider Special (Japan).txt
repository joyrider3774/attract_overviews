Michael Knight is a man on a mission. Reborn, so to speak, after getting shot in the face, Knight decides to dedicate his life to fighting for justice. Self-made billionaire Wilton Knight hires Michael to be the lead field agent in his Knight Foundation's public justice organization, part of which includes the developoing of KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand), a superpowered, intelligent souped-up Pontiac Trans-Am. KITT can drive 300 miles an hour, is bulletproof, fireproof, can talk, and helps Michael fight injustices in the world.
