Pack-In-Video was not the most amazing publisher for the PC Engine system and here they are back with the horizontal shooter Power Gate. The player takes control of a high-tech fighter plane and fly through canyons, enemy cities and giant battle cruisers. The fighter plane starts with a simple and slow vulcan gun which can be upgraded during the game by destroying flashing enemies, often in the shape of planes or missiles. Other power-ups are also available, like ground bombs or energy-cells restoring one of your plane shield bar. However, your fighting plane can also carry a secondary weapon. There are six of them including Homing missiles, Napalm Bomb, 8-ways and even one interesting option which will mirror your plane and triple its fire-power. This secondary weapons are triggered using the other action button, they can be collected in the same way the other items are and can be stocked up.
