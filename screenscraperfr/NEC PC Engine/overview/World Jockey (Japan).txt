World Jockey is a horse racing game, we have in particular a "Family Game" mode which itself is a sub-mode of "Jockey Play" mode, where you choose the number of races you want to do (four, eight, twelve or sixteen).
The madness of the racecourse will begin to seize you, from the betting screen, where we choose on which horses we want to bet! For the uninitiated, know that we put on the couple that we think will be the winner (unless you're really stupid ...) and it is possible to multiply his chances of winning, to bet on three different couples. Each horse has its own hill, which is attributed to him according to his attitudes towards the terrain on which he will run and his previous performances. Without wishing to bore you with mathematical formulas, also know that in case of victory, your gain will be inversely proportional to the winning couple's edge ... Logic.
