Tsuppari Oozumou essentially means "Shove Sumo", Tsuppari being a move performed by Sumo wrestlers to push their opponent out of the ring. The game works like any other tournament-based fighter: The player character must fight a series of increasingly difficult opponents until they reach the top and are declared Yokozuna: The highest rank of Sumo.
