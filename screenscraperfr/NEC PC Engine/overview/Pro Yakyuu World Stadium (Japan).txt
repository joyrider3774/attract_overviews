The game involves ten teams - nine based freely on pro clubs of Japanese baseball, and the Namco team whose list is filled with characters from the older Namco games. Neither the teams nor the names are licensed (which happened only in 1992), and some of the teams are amalgams of real clubs - the 'R' team, abbreviation for 'Railways', is formed in from a mix of players from the three clubs owned by rail companies: the Kintetsu Buffaloes (missing in 2004), the Nankai Hawks (now Fukuoka Softbank Hawks) and Hankyu Braves (now the Buffalo Orix). There are also some hidden teams accessible via password.
