Yuu Yuu Jinsei, or Victory Life, is a board game simulation which shares more than a few similarities to Milton Bradley's The Game of Life, not least of which include the automobile player pieces and the player's journey through various stages of life via a series of randomly occurring events. The game is actually licensed to Takara, the Japanese publisher of the board game (who would also create a few Game of Life video games of their own).

The goal is to make it to retirement with the most assets. The player can also get married, have kids and experience various other important life changes, but the primary goal is the acquisition of funds. The player is also able to invest funds and gamble, the outcome of which is dependent on pure luck.
