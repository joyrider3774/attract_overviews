Atomic Robo-Kid Special is a PC Engine adaptation of Atomic Robo-Kid, originally released by UPL for the Arcade in 1988. Unlike the versions released for other systems, which were all straight Arcade conversions, the PC Engine was rebuilt from scratch and thus carries the "Special" modifier in its title.The PC Engine version would never be released outside of Japan. GameplayAs with the standard Atomic Robo-Kid, the eponymous robotic war machine passes through a series of stages to find the exit. Each exit is blocked by a boss enemy, which often needs to be destroyed before the exit becomes accessible. Atomic Robo-Kid can collect up to three weapon upgrades and switch between them: if they lose a life, they lose the presently equipped upgrade but keep the others.The game will switch up how each stage is presented. The first two stages are side-scrollers, while others include a single-screen "duel" with a rival, a maze-like stage that the player explores in various directions and other divergences.
