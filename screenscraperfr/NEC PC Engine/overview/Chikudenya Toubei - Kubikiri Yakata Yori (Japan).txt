Chikudenya Toubei (alternately Toubee, Tobe) is an adventure game originally released on the MSX2 in 1989 and ported to the PC Engine the following year. The player uses a menu of commands to move, pick up items, talk to NPCs and other necessary steps.

Referred to as a "digital comic", the game has a number of cutscenes that play out during the more dramatic parts of the game. The game also includes puzzles, including a sequence where the player recreates the face of a victim from memory using a number of facial features like scars and eyebrows.
