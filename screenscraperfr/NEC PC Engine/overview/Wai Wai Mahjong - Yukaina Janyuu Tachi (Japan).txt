Wai Wai Mahjong ("wai wai" is Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound of a noisy/busy location) is a Mahjong game in which the player plays against various cartoonish opponents including a racing car driver and a nun. The game is one-on-one - unlike actual Mahjong which is generally played with four players - due to the limitations of Mahjong simulators back in the 8-bit/16-bit era.

Wai Wai Mahjong is the second Mahjong game for the PC Engine (after Sengoku Mahjong) and was only released in Japan.
