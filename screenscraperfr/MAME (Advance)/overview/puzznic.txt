Puzznic is a puzzle game in which the aim is to move symbol-bearing blocks onto identically-symboled blocks in order to eliminate them. Blocks can only be moved left or right, or dropped downwards. 

The order in which the blocks are eliminated needs careful planning, as it's sometimes necessary to destroy three blocks at a time, or use blocks as bridges for other blocks. Some puzzle screens have moving background blocks that act as elevators, making careful timing essential.
