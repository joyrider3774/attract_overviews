Up to three players choose to be one of three monster truck characters, each indicated by a different name and color: Daddy's Girl (red), Captain Crush (yellow) or Sheriff Perry (blue). If only one or two people are playing the game, there will be one or two black, computer-controlled monster trucks called Black Lightning who will compete in the race. Players repeatedly press both of the Tire buttons to propel their monster truck and use the "Wheelie" lever to make the truck do a wheelie to help overcome obstacles.
Some of the races on this game include speed rallies, car crushes, high jumps, sled pulls, etc. The game will continue if you manage to make to first place in one of the races during the play. If you only get second place, third place or fail to finish the race three times, the game will end. However, continuous play is available.
