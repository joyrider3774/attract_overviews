Star Wars Arcade is a superb 3-D shoot-em-up for one or two players, based on the legendary 1977 movie of the same name. In the two player game, one player takes on the role of the pilot, who controls both the speed and direction of the fighter ship, and who can only shoot at the centre of the screen. The second other player takes on the role of the 'gunner' and can target a much larger area on-screen.
