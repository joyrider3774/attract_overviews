Line of Fire is a lightgun controlled shoot-em-up for one or two players, in which two commandos find a special weapon - a vehicle mounted, automatic machine pistol - hidden deep within an enemy base. Before they can escape to report their findings, however, they find themselves surrounded by enemy forces and must blast their way through enemy lines and escape, using the enemies' own super weapon against them.
