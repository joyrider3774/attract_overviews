Dynamite Cop is a 3D beat 'em up for up to two players in which players play as either Bruno Delinger, Jean Ivy, or Eddie Brown and fight through levels on board a cruise ship and on a deserted island to save the President's daughter from a band of modern-day pirates led by Wolf "White Fang" Hongo, the main antagonist from the first game. The classic Sega arcade game Tranquilizer Gun (1980) is included as a bonus game on the Dreamcast version. Clearing all missions will enable you to play Tranquilizer Gun an unlimited number of times.
