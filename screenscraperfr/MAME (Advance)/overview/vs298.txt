The Virtua Striker video games are arcade-style football/soccer sports games by Sega. Originally developed by Sega AM2, the series moved to Amusement Vision with Virtua Striker 3. But the series moved again to Sega AM2 with Virtua Striker 4. The original Virtua Striker, released in 1994, was the first association football game to use 3D computer graphics, and was also notable for its early use of texture mapping,[1] along with Sega's own racing video game Daytona USA.
