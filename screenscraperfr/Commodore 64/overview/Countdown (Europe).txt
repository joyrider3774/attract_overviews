Countdown is a Channel 4 TV show which has continued into the 2010s, despite the death of original host Richard Whiteley in 2005. It's a words-and-numbers game show, and the original format of 6 letters games, 2 numbers games and a conundrum, is recreated here. There is no computer opponent, so 2 people are required.

In the letters round, a selection of 9 letters is formed by alternately choosing a vowel or consonant, and the players have 30 seconds to find the longest available word. Generated letter combinations are not always realistic with the show. As in Computer Scrabble, the full dictionary is not stored in memory, so the game will ask if the words you enter are real. The longest word scores its length, with 18 points for a 9 letter word - both players score for equal length words.
