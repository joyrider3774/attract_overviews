Enforcer, which is also named Katakis 2, is another horizontally scrolling space shooter by Manfred Trenz, which he wrote for the Golden Disk under the alias "The Master". You fly with an orbital glider through 6 different zones with rising difficulty level and each one big enemy at the end.

The Enforcer-Fullmetal-Megablast is a battle glider, state-of-the-art. In the basic equipment it has a high performance pulse energy engine and a plasma rapid fire blaster. Moreover the EFM possesses a power beam, whose fire power is enough to desintegrate heavy armoured and big enemies.

The EFM can versatilely be expanded and upgraded, by adding several modules, that appear in the course of the game. At the beginning four gliders are available, each of them is equipped with 3 smart bombs. In every zone further extra gliders are hidden, which only catch your eye when looking closely. By touching them they are added to your account.
