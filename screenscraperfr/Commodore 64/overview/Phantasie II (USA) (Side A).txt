Phantasie II is the sequel to the role-playing game Phantasie. Nothing has changed substantially: the gameplay and the graphics are identical to Phantasie. The adventuring party travels from town to town using a overview map of the countryside. There are many dungeons to explore and many different monsters to battle.
