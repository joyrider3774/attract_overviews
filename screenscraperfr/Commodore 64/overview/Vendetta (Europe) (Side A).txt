Your brother, a highly regarded professor who works for the Ministry of Defence, has pulled you through a personal hell. If it wasn't for him, where would you be after your heroic career in the army came to an abrupt end. A one-time war hero, you had put your unit on the map. You were the best and they knew it. A role model to all the young rookies. Your methods, though questionable, got the right results. However, your type worried the men at the top: "no man is bigger
than the job", you had to go...
Intent on obtaining the secret formula your brother has devised for developing the ultimate weapon, a blood-thirsty terrorist gang has kidnapped him and his daughter. The same terrorist syndicate you had dispersed in Saigon some years previously.
Your work now seemed incomplete... You have to squash them once and for all...
The police think you were involved in the kidnapping, so you must also endeavour to clear your name.
Your paramilitary skills will be tested to the full. With your own personal collection of weaponry and an elite weapon system installed in your Ferrari F40, your strategic mission unfolds across the country.
There are docklands, army camps, airports and parks, all linked with hazardous driving sectors where possible death looms with every turning and every new piece of the puzzle solved.
This has become personal...This is now a VENDETTA.
...IT'S PAY-BACK TIME...
