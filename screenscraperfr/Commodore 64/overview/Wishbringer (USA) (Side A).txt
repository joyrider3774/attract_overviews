In Wishbringer, you're a postal clerk in a small seaside village called Festeron. You deliver a strange envelope to a magic shop, and discover that an old woman's black cat has been kidnapped by "the Evil One." The old woman asks for your help, and when you leave the magic shop, you find yourself trapped in a nightmare world. Your once-quit town is now full of goons, trolls, vultures, fortress-like towers, and assorted wickedness. You become entangled in the struggle between Good and Evil; extraordinary help is found only in unusual places. Everyone seeks to possess a magic stone of dreams known as Wishbringer; but only you can find it and use its powers to make your town safe again. And you only have a few hours!
