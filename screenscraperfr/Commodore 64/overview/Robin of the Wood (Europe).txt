The Sheriff had in his possession a certain arrow, made of solid silver, engraved with
characters as ancient as the very forest. It was indeed the 'Shaft of power' of the Saxon
nation, symbol of freedom and peace, more precious than the crown of the kingdom itself
to the Saxons. Yet it was with this arrow as bait that the Sheriff planned to capture this
mysterious 'Robin of the Wood'. He well knew of the importance of the Silver Arrow to
the peasants of his domain, indeed to offer it as a prize, as though it were a mere trinket or
bauble, appealed to him as a prime insult to the serfs, and worthwhile simply for that
reason. It was when he realised that such a prize, whilst meaningless to himself, would be
certain to attract Robin to the contest, that he finally decided. There was to be a great
archery contest - the prize was to be the Silver Arrow - and for the Sheriff, the main
prize was to be the death or capture of Robin.
On the day of the contest the woods were swarming with Norman soldiers the Sheriffs
men. They had orders to shoot on sight, and shoot to kill.
