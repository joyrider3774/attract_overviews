Take the challenge! The evil Death Adder has kidnapped the King and his daughter, and is lurking in his lair with the precious Golden Axe. Only you can rescue the rulers of the Land of Yuria and set their people free.
But can you battle through the six levels of this action-packed quest that is faithful to the coin-op original?
Use magic to blast your enemy; slash and hack with your trusty weapon? or climb onto the back of a fire-breathing Bizarrian to deal death to the foe.
Hectic combat action awaits you...
