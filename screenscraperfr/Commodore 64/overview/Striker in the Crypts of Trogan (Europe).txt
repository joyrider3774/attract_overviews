As a noble and righteous wizard, you must beat the evil Trogan the Diabolical. This involves travelling through flick-screen Switchblade style environments both above and below ground. Using your sword, you must flatten Trogan's many henchmen, and avoid skeletons. You have limited energy, but can collect top-ups. Tokens to both improve and weaken your weaponry are also scattered throughout.
