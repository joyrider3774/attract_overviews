Ekim (a Giant Ant) who was discovered by Pirates in 1647, was trained by them to recover treasure. On the caribbean island where he lives, is a hut where he must store the treasure. He can jump quite long distances, and walk on anything solid, i.e. land, logs, the bridge, turtles, crocodiles, or magic islands. He must step safely on the turtles, because not only are they slippery, but they tend to dive underwater when crocodiles are around. Ekim could drown, thereby losing a life.nnEkim uses up energy in his travels, which he must replenish by eating the foods which grow on the islands. To remove treasure, Ekim must get in and out of the chest while the lid is open. Since he can only enter the chest once on each round trip, he must collect as much as possible while in the chest. Every third successful trip the Pirates will return to remove the treasure collected.nnThe number of lives is shown on the island at the bottom right of the screen. Score is shown at the top right, and remaining energy appears on the island at the bottom left.
