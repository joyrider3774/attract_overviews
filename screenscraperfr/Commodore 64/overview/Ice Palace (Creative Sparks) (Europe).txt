The wicked Ice Queen has murdered the good king and placed the kingdom under a terrible spell of forever winter. The young prince of the now frozen realm ascends the Ice Palace to collect the scattered and hidden pieces of his father's crown that can be used to vanquish the forces of evil. Once the whole crown is found, the Ice Queen can be destroyed.

The player is required to navigate through a honeycomb like maze and find the seven pieces of the golden crown, whilst fighting off enemies and avoiding traps. With each piece of the crown found, the player is taken to the next level. During an encounter, the player must use verbal commands to find the crown pieces. The player has limited time to find the whole crown before the holy candle melts and the game's good-and-evil meter degrades to evil.
