The player controls a llama which is positioned at the bottom of the screen and spiders descend into the play area  using threads, breaking them and dropping to the ground before mutating and mounting a crawling attack. The llama's primary weapon is it's own spittle, which is fired up at a 45 degree angle from horizontal in the direction the beast is facing, before ricocheting off one side of the play area, the otherwise useless planar shield high above the llama's head and then the other side of the play area before slamming into the ground and stopping. That shield can also be positioned vertically with the joystick, allowing the player to change how the spit moves around the screen and in turn aim at attackers or their threads pretty much anywhere.
