After flying your trusty ship Hunter too close to a black hole, you find yourself lost in space on the wrong side of the galaxy, surrounded by sprawling, hive-like cities. At the core of each city lie mysterious alien Starcells â€“ these contain valuable navigational data and must be collected to plot a course back home.

The aim of each level is to blast through the hive and grab the Starcells, a task made more challenging by the invincible Worker cells which patrol the cities repairing any damage inflicted. These Workers also bring the hive's defenses to life, causing them to spew deadly spores that can only be resisted by using your ship's trusty Perma-Shields.

The game features over 180 levels spread across 21 star systems. When all the Starcells on a level have been collected you'll enter the Bonus Game where you can earn a Perma-Shield and an extra life. You must complete every level within each star system to advance to the next; however, should you manage to collect four flashing Starcells you'll automatically jump to the next system.

As you progress through the different star systems you'll encounter an array of diverse and challenging hive types, including Attackers that throw out deadly spores, Darkcells which are only visible on radar, Switchers that change direction without warning, Jumpgates which jump to random locations, and Blackouts which plunge the hives into darkness.

Do you have the dexterity, precision timing and psychopathic blasting skills to find your way home to Hunter's Moon...?
