One of such military installations, ARTROCK 6, had turned rogue after being hit by a violent storm, its computer-controlled defensive systems firing upon anything that comes close. The player, being a top pilot, has been chosen to fly an upgraded F-14+2d Tomcat jet to destroy this electronic madness. F-14 Tomcat is a Flight Simulation game, published by Activision, which was released in 1988.
