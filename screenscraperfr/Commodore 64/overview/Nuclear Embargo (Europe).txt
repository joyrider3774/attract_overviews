The source of Earth's energy and power is nuclear fission, obtained from a rare mineral called Uranium 235 which was discovered in the early part of the 21st Century after earth's fossil fuel supply finally ran out. Uranium 235 itself finally ran out but huge deposits of the mineral were discovered on the many moons of Saturn and a deal was brokered with the dictator called Rayol the first to supply Earth with this precious mineral. Centuries later and Saturn has a new Premier called Rayol IV or Rayol the Perverse and he has decided that he requires a zoo containing different races of the Earth's inhabitants and so has demanded Earth give him 1000 of it's inhabitants. Earth rejected this claim and so Rayol has stopped Uranium 235 from being delivered to Earth and with stockpiles on Earth getting low and the potential for mass starvation something has to be done. Instead of sending a mass force to wage war on Rayol and the planet Saturn, the leaders of Earth have decide to send one man to participate in a surprise raid. You have been the man selected for this important mission, and in your ship loaded with nine robots you have to visit all of Saturn's moons, transport down a robot and collect as much Uranium 235 as you can.
