You play as the alien Zamzara captured and forced to escape from a twisted laboratory complex. A bomb is set to go off and you have to search for and leave in your ship before the time runs out. After 15 minutes it's game over. Along the way you come face to face (some of the enemies are literally faces shooting projectiles at you) with enemies both big and small. Defeat them with your arsenal of weapons which include explosive special abilities that spread out to each side - very efficient against heaps of smaller enemies.

Being a budget title and coming in relatively late in the C64 life cycle, it is known for its smoothly scrolling visuals and amazing soundtrack by Charles Deenen of Maniacs of Noise. It was also infamous for having a high difficulty, even for its time.
