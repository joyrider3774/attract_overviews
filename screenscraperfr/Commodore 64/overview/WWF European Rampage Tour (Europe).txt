Ocean's second wrestling game is tag-team-based, taking the player through four fights around major European cities. The player assembles a two-man team from Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Bret 'Hitman' Hart and Macho Man Randy Savage. Combat takes place both in and out of the ring, although a wrestler can't spend more than ten seconds at a time outside the ring. Once opponents are stunned, it becomes possible to throw them, which inflicts real damage to their energy bar. Many combination moves are available, including jumping off the ropes and landing on an opponent to pin him. WWF European Rampage Tour is a game based on the World Wrestling Federation, created by Arc Developments in 1992 for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and MS-DOS. It capitalizes on the success of the previous WWF game for home computers, WWF WrestleMania, and was aimed predominantly at the European markets. It was the last WWF game released strictly for home computers until the release of WWF With Authority! in 2001.
