13 years after the classics Turrican 1+2, an inofficial successor of the series has been completed as freeware -- and this game is absolutely worth playing. The game consists of 5 Level, and each level is divided into sublevels, of course with intermediate and end bosses. The first two levels are kept in the traditional Turrican type, so they are both jump'n run levels scrolling into all directions. World 3 is - as in Turrican 2 - a horizontally scrolling spaceship shoot-em-up. Level 4 is a jump'n run, which scrolls only vertically and which requires exactly placed jumps. It is also not possible to turn into a gyroscope here. World 5 is only a vertically scrolling jump'n run and was equipped with moving platforms (so the same as Turrican 2 on the Amiga, on the C64 there was a jetpack!)
