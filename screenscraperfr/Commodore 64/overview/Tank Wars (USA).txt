Tank Wars is a simple single screen action game for two players that is similar to the Atari 2600 game Combat. Each player controls a tank and has to shoot down the opponent. Each kill gives the player one point and the one that first reaches ten points will win the game. The game can be played with or without barriers that offer some protection. When used the game starts with each player placing nine rectangular barriers on the battlefield.
