Wait, you say, wasn't this an Infocom title? Actually, this one came out first on the budget publisher Mastertronic's catalog. It's a vastly different game than the Infocom one - you wander around as one of a number of characters trying to build up your rapport with the people, doing battle and working your way up to becoming a shogun. An obscure title that I always loved - and the very odd graphics and gameplay, on a 2D surface  where you're always flying everywhere, were so strange, but in the end that made it a memorable game.
