This football simulation focuses on international football, allowing you to play a tournament or single friendly matches. Up to 8 human players can be involved in the tournament. Options include three skill levels, variable match lengths and a choice of sound or music (or both on some versions).nnnnThe match is viewed from the side, although it switches to a 3D view when the ball is close to the goal. The ball roughly sticks to the player's foot. Set pieces are controlled by moving an aiming cross-hair.
