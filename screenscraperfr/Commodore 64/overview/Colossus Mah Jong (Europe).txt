This game is an adaption of the Chinese board game Mahjong. The basic playing principle (the game uses the official British rule set): the basic pool consists of 144 playing stones with different motives. Every player receives 14 out of them. With every turn, players remove one of the stones and other players can take them (but only if they can use it to shape certain patters with the stones already in their possession). The winning condition is to create the "Mah Jong" stone combination.
