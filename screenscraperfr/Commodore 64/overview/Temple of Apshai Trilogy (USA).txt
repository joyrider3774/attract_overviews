The Temple of Apshai Trilogy includes updated graphical versions of three classic Apshai games: ? Dunjonquest: Temple of Apshai ? Dunjonquest: Upper Reaches of Apshai ? Dunjonquest: Curse of Ra The game could be described as a graphical "rogue like", but actually it resembles the mainframe classic DND more, as you cannot see the whole level, but only your surroundings. Furthermore, the level maps are not randomized like in Rogue. Still, the game play has a lot in common with Rogue and other early dungeon crawls: A solo character explores a monster-infested, multi-level dungeon to grab some treasure, everything in top-down view.
