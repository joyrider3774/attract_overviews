Dizzy Panic!


"Dizzy hits the panic stations as the hydraulic crushers get closer and closer, belching steam - the machines going into termination sequence and its down to you to stop it."

Dizzy Panic! was a puzzle game similar to Tetris, which involved moving a wall left to right so that falling shapes can pass through the appropriately shapes holes in the wall.
