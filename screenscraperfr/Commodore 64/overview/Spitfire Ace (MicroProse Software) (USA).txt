Spitfire Ace is a combat flight simulator video game created and published by then-newly created MicroProse for several 1980s home computer systems. It was one of the first video games designed and programmed by Sid Meier. It was developed for Atari 400/800 (1982), Commodore 64 (1984) and DOS (as a booter, 1984). The Atari version was written by Meier and the game was ported to DOS by R. Donald Awalt. The Commodore 64 version was ported by Dale Gray and Ron Verovsky.
