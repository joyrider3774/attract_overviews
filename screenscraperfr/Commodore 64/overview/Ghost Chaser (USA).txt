In Ghost Chaser you will meet Harry the Ghost Chaser and a host of strange adversaries as you explore the 16 different rooms of mysterious Fairport Manor. Points are scored each time you blast the various Phantom Ghosts which materialise at random. The only way to capture these spirits is to find your way into the treasure room. Scattered throughout the manor are eight keys. As you find and collect these keys, additional doors open allowing you to go deeper and deeper into the manor. Watch out for the many tricky obstacles and above all, avoid contact with anything that moves! They'll send shivers up and down your spine!
