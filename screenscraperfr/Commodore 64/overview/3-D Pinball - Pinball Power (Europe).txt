3D Pinball Power is a very realistic pinball simulation. The table is designed as an "oldtimer pinball", which is built up very simply. With 5 balls you try to play as long as possible and reach a high score. As extras there is a "bonus display" (above the flippers), the corresponding "bonus trap" and if "special" is lit an extra ball. Targets are a "Black Hole" (between the three bumpers), three "Revolver Lines" (above the bumpers), a "Hairpin" (in the middle of the table), three "Tombstone Targets" (right of the middle of the table) and six "Sidebar Lights" (left and right of the middle of the table).
