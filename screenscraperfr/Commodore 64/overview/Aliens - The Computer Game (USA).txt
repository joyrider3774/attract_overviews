Story: There are places in the Universe where you do not go on your own... but nightmares return and the only way to get rid of them is to return to LV-426 and face them. To re-experience the horror. To master the fear. And this time... to win. Here is your chance to live through the excitement and action of the film "Aliens" once more. Between the original landing of the Drop Ship to the end fight with the Alien Queen, the six different game sequences put the destiny of Newt and the colonial marines into your hands. . . .

Aliens - The Computer Game by Activision is the game for the movie. Seemingly, it was only developed for the US market, as there is another game with the same name in Europe. But this game differs significantly from the other concerning the game principle. The game talked about here was later offered by the same company in Europe with the addition "US Version".

The game has 6 levels. Almost every level can be assigned to a different genre. In Level 1 you need to fly through a course of rings, in Level 3 on the other hand you need to stop Aliens in Space Invaders style.
