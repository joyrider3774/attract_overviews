Turbo Outrun the player in control of a male driver sitting alongside his girlfriend in a Ferrari F40, racing against the clock and a computer-controlled opponent in a Porsche 959 in a race across the United States. The goal is to reach Los Angeles from a starting point of New York City. Unlike the original Out Run, however, there are no branch roads to choose from. Instead, there is only one way from the start to the end of the road.
