Climb up the side of a series of 48-story buildings to collect suitcases full of money, while avoiding creepy monsters and falling objects that try to knock you off. Fortunately, you can strike back against the monsters by smashing them flat, by smashing them on the head. Don't linger too long, though, since they are soon resurrected, white and unsquishable. Squish 'Em is similar to Crazy Climber, with much faster gameplay.
