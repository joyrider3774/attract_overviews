It begins innocently: you see a blank screen and hear the Touch-Tones of a number being dialed, then a few rings, an answer, and the scrabbling sound of computers talking to each other over a modem. You type in a logon name and find that you are in a telecommunications service called "Actisource." Before the main menu finishes, though, the transmission is interrupted, and you see a message from the CIA, who has contacted you because you are "the world's greatest hacker." They ask you to accept a mission of the utmost importance: to steal the plans for a Russian project called the Doomsday Papers, thereby thwarting a Russian attempt at world domination.
But, of course, there's more to it than that. The papers are in a guarded vault in a Russian military installation, with the pieces of the vault's combination in four locked filing cabinets, only one of which you have the key for. The CIA has smuggled three small robots, called Mobile Remote Units (MRUs), which you can control using your computer and a piece of software called an MFSM (Multi-Function Switching Matrix) Emulator.
