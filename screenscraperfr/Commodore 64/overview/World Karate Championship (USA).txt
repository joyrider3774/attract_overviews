World Karate Championship is pretty much the same as International Karate (Editor's note:  International Karate never came out for the PC), with the exception that in WKC you're given the choice to compete in either Australia or Egypt. But the looks, the moves and everything else is identical. 

The objective of WKC is to get the highest possible dan (karate grade, determined by belt colour) and become the world champion. And of course, to get the highest score. 
In between all the fighting, there are action-sequences where you have to deflect bouncing balls etc, which gives you extra points.
