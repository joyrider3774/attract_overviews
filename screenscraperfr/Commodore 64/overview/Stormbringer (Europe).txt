Magic Knight finally returns home, having obtained a second-hand time-machine from the Tyme Guardians at the end of Knight Tyme. However, there has been an accident whilst travelling back and there are now two Magic Knights - the other being "Off-White Knight", the dreaded Stormbringer (so called because of his storm cloud which he plans to use to destroy Magic Knight). Magic Knight cannot kill Off-White Knight without destroying himself in the process. His only option is to find Off-White Knight and merge with him.
