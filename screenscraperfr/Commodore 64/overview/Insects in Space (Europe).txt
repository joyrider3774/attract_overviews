Insects in Space is a side-scrolling shooter with similarities to Defender. Insects killed everyone on Earth except a few babies. This causes the mystical leader of motherhood, St. Helen, to travel to Earth's remains and save the babies. The most important feature of this protagonist is the fact that she is topless and - as prominently mentioned in the manual - "big breasted", but she controls and shoots just like the space ship normally found in those games.
