A rather simple computer game, in which you have to try to slowly land a spaceship on Jupiter. For this you have three landing platforms. If you make it to land on one of the three platforms with slow falling speed in the yellow range (meter display at the right of the screen), you get points and a refill of the tank. The game is over when the tank display shows zero. The space ship is destroyed when landing with too high speed or when touching the rock walls of the planet.
