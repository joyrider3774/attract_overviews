Lords of Conquest is a strategy game by Electronic Arts from 1986, which was first written for the Apple II and then ported to the C64. It is based on the board game "Borderlands" by the English game manufacturer Eon and is designed for either up to four players or a single player against a computer opponent. The one who makes it to build or conquer three towns and keep them at least for one game round is the winner. If several players start to gain control over their third town in the same round, the game will continue until one of them loses a town or builds a fourth town. There is the alternative that you completely eliminate your competitors, but from experience both human players and computer opponent (!) throw in the sponge before it comes to that. To be able to build and defend the required three towns or, if necessary, to capture the hostile towns, the players need resources (iron, coal, wood, gold and horses), which they can gain from the correspondingly marked provinces of the map and which need to be protected from the graps of the other players. While the game against a single opponent is limited to pure tactics with military units, a game with three or four players has an additional trading phase, in which resources can be swapped / begged / blackmailed. Additionally, the players can side with the attacker or the defender during an attack. With this Lords of Conquest also allows many diplomatic interaction by founding and breaking (short-lived) allies and at the end everyone screams in confusion and goes for each other's throats... the way it should be! The game comprises twenty ready-made maps (Northamerica, China, Mediterranean area, world etc.) as well as the possibility to get new maps generated or create own maps in the editor.
