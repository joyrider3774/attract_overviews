Over the Aztecs broods a shadow of one of the most barbarous and horrible religions the world has ever known. Each year the Aztec priests sacrifice to their numerous gods many luckless human victims. Once you are chosen to be sacrificed you have only one chance of escape; you must compete in, and complete, an endurance and obstacle course of skill and daring to prove your worth.
Now, you have been chosen, and now you must discover and successfully conquer the "AZTEC CHALLENGE"!
