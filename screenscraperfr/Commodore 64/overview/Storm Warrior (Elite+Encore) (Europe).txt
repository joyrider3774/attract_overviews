Darkness has descended upon the land. The evil Witch Queen has cast a curse upon the Kingdom, summoning an awesome thunderstorm destined to last for one hundred years. Torrential rain, howling winds, floods and lightning will wreak death and destruction across the land, ruining crops and destroying villages, unless her malignant spell can be broken. It is your duty as Prince of the Kingdom to rid your people of this terrible enchantment, and to restore peace and tranquility to their lives. Armed only with a sword, your first task is to find her hellish castle, from where she and her undead guards control the elements. Beware of her awesome power: trust no-one, for no-one is safe from her spells and may be turned against you at any time. Remember ... trust no-one ... Storm Warrior is a 1989 beat 'em up game developed and released by Elite Systems for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum 8-bit home computer systems.
