First Strike by Elite Systems is a very good conversion of the Afterburner idea for the C64 from 1989. You control a fight jet, which is armed to the teeth, in 8 missions, which take place at different operation areas scattered all over the world: training missions in the Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean mission, Gulf mission, Arctic mission, Black Sea mission, Far East mission, East Russia mission, Central Europe mission. You can choose your weapons before a mission and at a stopover during the mission. Corresponding to the operation area the design of the landscape changes and you can even see cloud cover and fly over or under it..

You start the game with the rank "Rookie". For a promotion a mission must be solved completely, i.e. destroying the mission target and landing safely. (Landing and starting are done automatically, so you just have to reach the destination). To reach the highest rank all missions must be accomplished successfully. The order of the ranks: Rookie, Sergeant, 2nd Lieutenant, 1st Lieutenant, Captain, Major, L. Colonel, Colonel
