1943: The Battle of Midway is a shoot'em up on Commodore 64 that follows 1942. You are plunged into the heart of the Second World War. This time it is a question of recreating the intense battle off the coast of the Midway Islands. Compared to its predecessor, 1943 displays a health bar that empties when you are hit, but can be recharged with some bonuses.
