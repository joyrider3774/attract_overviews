A story that could happen anywhere: The eccentric inventor Elma Sniddle experiments with a new TV machine, as she gets the fatal idea to use one of the confidentially-looking crystals, which had rained down from a meteor shower in her garden, as an energy source. But as soon as she had built in the crystal, the machine awoke to (of course evil!) life and shot at her with concentrated beam of pure fuzz energy which turned her into a distorted copy of herself.
Unable to grab a clear thought, she staggered out of her flat, while the sinister television ran away towards the train station to take its heels. Only by a lucky coincidence she stumbled upon another crystal lying around in her garden and by this quickly changed back to normal. Then she promptly informed Helena Aldente from the CIB about the case and she put the special agent AGENT USA on the chase for the Fuzzbomb.

Agent USA is equipped with a VERY big hat and ten of the mysterious crystals and a CIB passport, which authorizes him to get handed out free tickets for the trains at all ticket booths in the whole country. But he has to hurry, as the Fuzzbomb transforms more and more honest and tax-paying people into mentally deranged Fuzzbodies and soon the whole nation will fall victim to the Fuzz. It would be the end of the world as we know it!
