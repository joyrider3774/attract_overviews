The game follows the movie, in that at the beginning of the game a crew member (not always, but often Kane) gives ?birth? to the alien. It's then up  to the rest of the crew the player controls to move around the three levels of the Nostromo using the air ducts, attempting to isolate the alien and destroy it. Or blow it out of the airlock of the Nostromo, or as in the movie set the self-destruct on the ship and get away in the escape pod.
