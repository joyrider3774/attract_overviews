"Jai Alai" is a game based on the Basque handball (or Basque "pelota"), a sport original from the Basque country which is very popular in the whole Spain, but also to a lesser extent in some regions of the United States since the early XX century, the times of the European migrations.

The games are disputed between two teams (composed of two players each one), with a scoring system very similar to the one of table tennis; it is, we will be able to score if we are in possession of the serve, in opposite case, our successes will only allow us to recover it. But instead of a net, we will have to play with a wall, using it as our "third player".
