Gauntlet: The Third Encounter is an arcade-style action game by Atari, that was released on the Atari Lynx handheld in 1990. The game can be played by one to four players simultaneously. It introduced new character classes like ?Nerd? or ?Punkrocker? and was one of a few games that used the ?vertical mode? of the Atari Lynx, another being the port of Klax. The story: a crystal falls from the sky and lands in a castle, and it must be retrieved from within its 40 mazes type area. A year later U.S. Gold and Tengen would release another completely different game called Gauntlet III: The Final Quest.
