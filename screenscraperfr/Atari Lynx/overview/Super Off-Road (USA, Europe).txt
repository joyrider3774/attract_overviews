Pile into the pickup and head for the stadium, it's time for some mud-
stompin' action with SUPER OFF-ROAD.  In this Lynx version of the Tradewest
arcade game, four racers drive monster trucks around a variety of dirt tracks.
Players must deal with ramps, hills, valleys, and more as they race for the
finish, while trying to pick up extra money and nitro boosts along the way.
Then they take those winnings to the shop to buy better equipment before the
next race begins.  Up to four Lynxes can be connected for multi-player
competition.
