BS Chrono Trigger: Character Library is essentially a bestiary containing not only all of the playable characters, but all of the enemies as well. The game was released for the Japan only Satellaview in 1995, and was developed by Squaresoft and published by Nintendo. The game is nothing more than an addon to Chrono Trigger, containing every sprite for each character and enemy, as well as a brief description of each one. BS Chrono Trigger: Character Library is also included in Final Fantasy Chronicles.
