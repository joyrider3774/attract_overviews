A sequel to the Shubibinman Turbografx action platformers developed exclusively for the SNES.

A new gang of cyborg-enhanced goons threatens peace in the city, so "Doc" decides to test his newest creations: Raita and Azuki, by sending them to destroy all the baddies and restore peace.

The game plays as an 2D action platformer as previous entries in the series, in which you proceed through each stage pummeling enemies and collecting power-ups to enhance your powers. Now for the first time each character has unique abilities and attacks, furthermore each character has a charging attack that can be used to energize your partner thus encouraging teamplay in the two-player cooperative mode.
