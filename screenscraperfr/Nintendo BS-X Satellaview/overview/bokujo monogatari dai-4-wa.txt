BS Bokujou Monogatari is a Downloadable 4-part Soundlink game for the Satellaview that was broadcast in at least 2 runs between September 2, 1996 and November 30, 1996. The game is a life-simulation game and it comes as a pseudo-sequel to the earlier-broadcast (July 1996)/retail release Bokujou Monogatari commonly known internationally as "Harvest Moon"; this has given the series the fan-nickname "BS Harvest Moon" as a result. Together with the game (typically immediately before and after), 10-minute broadcasts of a related nature were released entitled BS Bokujou Monogatari Torisetsu (a digital instruction manual) and Bokujou Monogatari no Kekka (a score/results program).
