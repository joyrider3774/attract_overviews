Nintama Rantarou 2 ("Ninja Boy Rantarou 2") is a Super Famicom game featuring characters from the Nintama Rantarou anime. As well as a Super Famicom release, the game was also one of the Satellaview broadcasts.

The game expands its scope a little, including more stage variation - including Mode 7 vehicle sections - and three new playable characters with the Kunoichi trio of Yuki, Tomomi and Oshige-chan. The Kunoichi are a trio of female ninjas in training that contrast with the three usual protagonists Rintarou, Kirimaru and Shinbei, occasionally tricking them.
