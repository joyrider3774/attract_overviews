BS Super Mario Collection is a remix of Super Mario Collection (the Japanese name for Super Mario All-Stars) for the Satellaview, an add-on for the Super Famicom. The game was released in four installments. As the game played, streamed audio would enhance the gameplay experience with special music and voice acting featuring Japanese celebrities. Its "companion title" is BS Super Mario USA. A Fire Flower icon represents Nae's house, which is hosted by a Satellaview Radio Personality Nae YÅ«ki. Here, Mario can choose to activate ghost mode which allows him to become Fire Mario once he exits the level if he is Small or Super Mario. This in turn disables players from participating in rankings. A Treasure Ship icon, which is unlocked when Mario finishes all available levels in the World. Toad's House is now just a screen where the player selects the treasure chest, rather than having Mario actually walk to the chest and open it. There is a timer in the bottom left of the screen that counts down to the end of a World cycle. At the beginning of each world, there is a list of all the levels, and a picture with dialog underneath it.
