Unlike the previous Dragon Slayer games, which were all side-scrolling action RPGs, The Legend of Heroes is a far more straightforward turn-based RPG of the Dragon Quest mold. It allowed for a party of up to four characters and had a few modern upgrades, such as allowing the player to distribute stats after a level up, target separate monsters and restart a battle if their party gets wiped out.

It received one direct sequel, Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes II, before the series would drop the Dragon Slayer prefix and continue as a separate Falcom property.
