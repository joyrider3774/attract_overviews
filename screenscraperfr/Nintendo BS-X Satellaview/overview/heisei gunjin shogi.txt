Heisei Gunjin Shougi is a traditional Japanese game. We start by choosing a place in the city in which the game will take place, then after a short cutscene, we place small characters on the boxes. Then the game begins. The game board consists of the chosen decor which is divided into boxes. We move these "pawns" in turn, respecting the rules for moving the Shougi and when 2 pieces meet, a small scene shows their "fight".
