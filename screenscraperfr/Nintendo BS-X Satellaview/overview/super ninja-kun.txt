Super Ninja-Kun is a 1994 Japan-only side-scrolling action game developed and published by Jaleco for the SNES. It is a graphically updated version of UPL's Ninja-kun Arcade games from the 1980s, which Jaleco had previously adapted for consoles (as well as creating their own spin-offs, named Ninja Jajamaru-kun).nnnnAs well as featuring 16-bit graphics the game now also features a story mode, bosses, an upgradable health gauge (the Arcade game only allowed Ninja-kun to take a single hit) and multiple weapon types. Ninja-kun can also create a powerful one-off magic blast by collecting the souls of dead enemies as they float off the screen. The game also includes a two-player cooperative mode.nnnnSuper Ninja-kun is not to be confused with Super Ninja Boy, another ninja-themed action game for the SNES.
