A long time ago, before our history began, wizards - both good and evil - battled for supremacy of the earth. It was a time of magic and adventure when all men possessed special powers.

You are the only remaining honorable wizard with the knowledge to harness all the forces of good to defeat Narzod and destroy his sinister fortress. But Narzod has prepared for your approach and guards his realm with deadly creatures of darkness, including the Mystic Hurler. Beware, and approach the Fortress of Narzod with great caution!
