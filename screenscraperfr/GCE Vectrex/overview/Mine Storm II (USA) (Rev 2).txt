Mine Storm is the built-in game that came with every Vectrex unit. It was also released in a 3-D version that required the use of the Vectrex 3D Imager and Mine Storm 2 is a debugged version of Mine Storm.

One of the built-in versions of Mine Storm had a glitch that made the game crash at level 13, so GCE decided to send a copy of Mine Storm 2 to gamers that wrote to the company and complained.

This game is rare, because most of the gamers didn't know about the offer, and also because not many gamers got to level 13.
