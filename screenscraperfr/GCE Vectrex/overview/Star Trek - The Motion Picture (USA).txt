Welcome, Captain Kirk, to your command on the Starship Enterprise. Your mission is to seek out and destroy the enemy Klingon Mothership. Travel through nine sectors of space, each more difficult, or take a shortcut through the Black Hole. Be careful ... the Klingons and Romulans are hiding in space, waiting to destroy you at every turn!
