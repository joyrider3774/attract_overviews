Elf Bowling 1
Strap on your best pair of bowling skates and polish up your shiny Christmas ball. It's time to save Christmas from those greedy little union elves. Help Santa show those elves what the true meaning of 'strike' is! 

Elf Bowling 2 - 'Elves in Paradise'
The snickering elves are back with Santa, but there is a new twist as Santa's ne'er-do-well brother, Dingle Kringle, joins Santa and the Elves on a cruise ship headed for an island adventure. Compete in a crazy shuffleboard tournament, with the Elves serving as "pucks" and providing their own special, colorful commentary.
