Twenty years after their debut on the NES, mountain climbers Popo and Nana return to scale the heights as part of the NES Classic Series for the Game Boy Advance. As Popo (player two plays as Nana), you must use your trusty mallet to work your way up the mountain by chipping away at the blocks overhead and then jumping through the resulting hole. Your mallet is also useful for eliminating pesky enemies, including polar bears, seals, and mountain men.
