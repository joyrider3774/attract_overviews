Players take on the role of each of the four Cheetah Girls â€“ Galleria, Chanel, Aquanetta and Dorinda, plus Galleriaâ€™s pedigree pooch, Toto. To prepare for a big gig in Barcelona, players create their own tunes in the music studio, choreograph dance moves and coordinate Cheeta-licious outfits. The game also features mini jobs for each girl -- flip ribs on the grill with Aqua; teach dance with Dorinda; make music with Galleria and Toto at home or coordinate outfits at a high-end fashion store with Chanel.
