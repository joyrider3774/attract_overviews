PokÃ©mon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire has all the features you'd demand of a pinball game, including bonus tables, lots of bumpers and ways to score massive points. As with your standard videogame pinball game, the left button on the D-pad and the A-button control the flippers with the R/L triggers used to shake the table. The catch here is that everything is themed in PokÃ©mon. Instead of a ball, you make use of a PokÃ©ball. Instead of standard bumpers, you're hitting the PokÃ©ball against other PokÃ©mon, and the ultimate goal is of course to "catch 'em all". The game features 200 PokÃ©mon, two main tables, and link cable support.
