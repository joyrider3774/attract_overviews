The addictive racer you all have grown to love in the past is back and is even more addicting on the GBA. Featuring the classic overhead view presented in the original series we go one step further and bring it the depth it needed on the GBA using our popular 'bengine' suite of tools. Coupled with intense gameplay, some of the most bright colors on the GBA and an addicting four-player multiplayer this is a game you can't miss. This Game Boy Advance installment in the long-running action racing series only came out in Europe.
