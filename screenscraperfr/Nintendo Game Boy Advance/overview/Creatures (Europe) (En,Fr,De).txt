With Creatures you'll discover the fascinating universe of Artificial Intelligence. Actually, virtual life in Creatures is created considering newest scientific research data - for the first time on a video game console!

The Norns' attributes and characteristics are handed down from generation to generation - as in real, actual life. In this way you can raise evermore intelligent (or stupid), friendly (aggressive), curious (indifferent), etc, Norns depending on your personal preferences. You will notice that in fact you can't protect them from all harm that's awaiting them. But the more you succeed, the more you will be proud of each Norn which you accompany to its old age. May you be blessed with masses of intelligent offspring!
