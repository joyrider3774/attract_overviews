An adventure game based on the sequel to Fox's CG animated film.

The Ice Age is ending and our subzero heroes return in this action adventure video game set in a melting paradise of water parks, geysers and tar pits. Manny the Mammoth, Sid the Sloth and Diego the Sabre-Toothed Tiger are back and realize that the melting glaciers will soon flood their valley. With the help of everyone's favorite sabre-toothed squirrel from the first movie, Scrat, help your big friends cross the perilous landscape to safety. Scrat will dig, swim, sniff, spin and roll his in his never-ending quest to collect acorns. In the process, he serves as the unwitting hero in the quest to save the land from a giant flood.
