Two games in one cartridge :

Sonic Advance

Sonic the Hedgehog has arrived for his first ever adventure on a Nintendo console. Sonic Advance combines elements from the original Sonic series on Sega's Genesis, as well as from the Dreamcast Sonic Adventure series.


Sonic Battle

Sonic Battle is a fast paced pseudo-fighting game, akin to Super Smash Brothers from Nintendo. Rather than being 3D side-scrolling, this game employs a 3D isometric view- not a static, sprite-based field though, it is comprised of actual texture-mapped polygons.
