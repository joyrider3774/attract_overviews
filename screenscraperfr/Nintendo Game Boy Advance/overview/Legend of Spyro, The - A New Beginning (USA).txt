The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning is the first game in The Legend of Spyro trilogy, a reboot of the Spyro the Dragon series. It was developed by Krome Studios and published by Sierra Entertainment for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and Game Boy Advance. Amaze Entertainment developed the Nintendo DS version.

The game utilizes the voices of celebrities, featuring Elijah Wood as the voice of Spyro, comedian David Spade as Sparx, Cree Summer as Cynder and Gary Oldman as Ignitus. Krome Studios planned to make a Crash Bandicoot game, but Sierra Entertainment asked them to develop The Legend of Spyro instead. The game has also been noted for beginning a more dark and complex plot to the Spyro series. Its success spawned two sequels and a planned CGI movie.
