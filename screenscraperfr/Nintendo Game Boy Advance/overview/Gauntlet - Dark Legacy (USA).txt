Following the arcade and console inspired time honored traditions of the genre, Gauntlet Dark Legacy puts players in a large, immersive world in which up to four players can go on a hack n slash adventure. Using eight characters ranging from Warriors (you know, the kind that NEEDS FOOD) to Wizards the game lets players destroy almost anything that moves with a wide variety of weapon and devastating magic.
