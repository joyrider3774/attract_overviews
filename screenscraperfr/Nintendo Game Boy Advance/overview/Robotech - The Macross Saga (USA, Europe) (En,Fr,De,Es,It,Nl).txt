A classic 2D shooter that artfully mixes side-scrolling and forced perspective gameplay. Play as a mighty fighter from the hit Robotech series as you battle to save planet Earth from total destruction. Auto cannon fire lights up the skies in this epic intergalactic war with the Zentradi legions. The best defense that Earth has is the Veritech Valkyrie, a fast-changing fighter that moves through the air with the grace of a dancer and packs the punch of an armored division!
