Two games in one cartridge :

Spider-Man - Mysterio's Menace

Set in New York, Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace enables players to assume the role of Spider-Man as they take on super-villain Mysterio and his illusory tricks for control of Manhattan. Spider-Man must fight a slew of Mysterio's sinister conspirators and gadgetry to get to the bottom of their plot and free New York from Mysterio's mind-warping grip. 

X2 - Wolverine's Revenge

During the 1960's, a Canadian named Logan was used in a government-conducted experiment known as Weapon X. Unbreakable adamantium was ingested into his bones, in an attempt to turn him into a "super-soldier". For the rest of his life, Logan (who adopted the nickname Wolverine) will have to fight against the beast inside him. Only after meeting Professor Xavier and his X-Men team, Wolverine is able to find a purpose in his life. However, as his memories return, he realizes that the Weapon X experiment has infected him with a deadly virus, and he has only two days to find the cure.
