Ice Age makes the jump to the small screen in this Game Boy Advance platformer. Based on events depicted in the motion picture, Ice Age tasks players with guiding both Manny the Mammoth and Sid the Sloth through ten levels of platform-oriented action. Starting out, players control Manny who, along with the human baby Roshan, must navigate a myriad of environments while keeping saber-tooth tigers, hedgehogs, and bees at bay. To do so, Manny is capable of hurling large nuts as makeshift projectiles at any on-screen enemies. Wild animals aren't the only obstacle players will encounter, as they'll need to move a sleeping rhinoceros to advance and inhale skunk fumes to float over dangerous chasms.
