Bookworm is a combination of Scrabble and Bejeweled, in which you create words by selecting letters from adjacent tiles. Completed words are converted to points and removed from the board. New tiles fall in from the top to fill in the empty tile positions. Watch out for fiery letter tiles that will burn through your other tiles one at a time. Creating longer words will stave off burning tiles and generate bonus tiles as well. Words containing bonus tiles are worth more points.
