This is the second game in the Petz Hamsterz series. Adopt a hamster to care for and train. Choose from five types of hamsterz. Watch your hamster grow and build his own Ham-Country that other hamsterz can move to. 

The better you raise your hamster, the bigger he becomes, and the more energy he has to build a big Ham-Country. Compete against your friends in mini-games.
