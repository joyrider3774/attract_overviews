J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth is a land of beauty, magic, and darkness. In The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, you follow Tolkien's narrative from the Shire to the halls of Moria, and finally to the banks of the River Anduin. Gameplay alternates between melee, archery, sorcery, and stealth as you control Frodo, Gandalf, and Aragorn. Join this band of heroes in their quest to destroy the One Ring, which contains all the power of the dark lord Sauron.
