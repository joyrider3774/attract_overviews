These twins went from cute little toddlers on television to international fashion examples in a matter of just a few years, and they're ready to celebrate their success with a night on the town. Join the duo for an evening of clubbing and high style, dancing to the beats of techno, house, and disco music for the duration of the handheld gaming adventure. Just how does one go about dancing on a Game Boy Advance? Well, your fingers will represent your feet, as you try to master the correct combination of buttons and direction pad taps which isn't exactly as easy as it seems. Of course, you're nothing without the right clothes; choose your own shoes, shirts, pants, hairstyles, and accessories in this all-inclusive experience. One of your primary objectives will be to unlock all of the game's secret steps, songs, and clothes and that will take a combination of smarts and reflexes.
