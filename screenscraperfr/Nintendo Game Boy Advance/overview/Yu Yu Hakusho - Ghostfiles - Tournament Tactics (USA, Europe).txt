Tournament Tactics immerses you in a challenging tournament set in the Yu Yu Hakusho universe. Create a team with up to five characters, and then use your players' unique combos, supermoves, and other attacks to exploit your opponents' weaknesses. Battlefields are based on locations from the Yu Yu Hakusho show, and you can unlock additional areas throughout the game. You can even challenge your friends and trade items using the Game Boy Advance link cable.
