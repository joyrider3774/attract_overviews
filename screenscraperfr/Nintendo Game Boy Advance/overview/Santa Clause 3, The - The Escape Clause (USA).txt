You'll have to overcome treacherous falling icicles, evil snowmen, powerful gusts of wind and lots of other obstacles. Take to the skies with Santa in his sleigh and battle the elements to deliver gifts to good boys and girls (and coal to the naughty.) Also included are puzzle-based challenges where you must help Santa's elves build toys in time for Christmas.
