As an Eggo builder, its your job to sort and organise air-dropped puzzle pieces to assemble platforms that gradually form a tower above a steadily rising ocean. Because water quickly seeps up through incomplete floors it is vital that you build complete platforms to slow the rising water. The goal is to reach the balloon that hovers high in the sky, however, to complicate matters, tower-tumbling and thieving enemies prowl the depths and soar the skies, looking for ways to drown your spirit - so work quickly!!
