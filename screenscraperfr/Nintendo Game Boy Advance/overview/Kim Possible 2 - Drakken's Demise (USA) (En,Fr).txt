Kim Possible's new adventure leads her into battle with Falsetto Jones, Gemini, Duff Killigan, Shego, and Dr. Drakken in four intense episodes. In each new episode, Kim gains gadgets and acrobatic abilities that allow her to bounce up walls, judo-flip henchmen, reflect laser beams, and spray hot sauce to melt icy obstructions. If all else fails, you can engage her stealth suit and make her invisible to enemy eyes. Once Kim acquires new gadgets and abilities, you can then replay earlier levels to access areas that were previously unreachable.
