Shrek has always loved his home-sweet-swamp, but ever since Lord Farquaad declared his land the "Kingdom's Grand Dumping Ground" there has been more junk around than any ogre needs. Now Shrek finds himself amidst the kingdom's not-so-grand trash and must find a way to get rid of it. So, Shrek has put the trash to work for him, creating the greatest racing vehicle of all time-Shrek's lean, mean ogre kart. Now Shrek and the fairy tale troops are ready to compete in the zaniest roadster challenge ever. Only one question remains: Who will be victorious in the race for the Dragon's treasure?
