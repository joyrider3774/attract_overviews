Two games in one cartridge : V-Rally 3 (V-Rally 3 for the Game Boy Advance adapts the console game of the same name to the handheld platform, offering its own selection of cars, tracks, modes and a platform-appropriate graphics engine. The main game mode is V-Rally Mode. It takes players through a rally championship over seven different countries, with each country's course consisting of distinct stages. Stages are taken on in groups of two, allowing for changing of car setup and repairs after every pair. Car setup options include a choice of tires (appropriate to road and weather conditions) as well as suspension, steering, brakes and gearbox. Bumping into the roadside during a race damages the car, with body, suspension, brakes, steering and turbos getting individual damage ratings. The repairs must be possible to be carried out within a time window or there is no choice but to drive on with the damage) and Stuntman (You play a stuntman who has the task of completing some difficult and challenging stunts for a film director. Get it right and he'll ask you on for another project, and pay you big time. Get it wrong, and it's time for a career change).
