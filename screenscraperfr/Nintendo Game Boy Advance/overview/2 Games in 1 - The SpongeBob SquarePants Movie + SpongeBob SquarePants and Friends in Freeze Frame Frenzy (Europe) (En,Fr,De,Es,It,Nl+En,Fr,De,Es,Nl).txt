An all-new adventure for SpongeBob SquarePants, based on the animated feature film. There's trouble in Bikini Bottom -- again! Someone has stolen King Neptune's crown and it appears as though Mr. Krabs is the culprit. Despite being passed over for a promotion by Mt. Krabs, SpongeBob and his faithful but dimwitted friend Patrick volunteer to make the perilous journey to Shell City (a place no one has ever returned from) to retrieve the crown and save Mr. Krabs' life.
