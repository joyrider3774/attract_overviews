Featuring multiple racetracks and a classic soundtrack, Rock N' Roll Racing puts players behind the wheel for an over-the-top demolition-racing experience. In the game, drivers take their pick from a variety of cars, each equipped with a selection of weaponry designed to help them outmaneuver the competition. Taking advantage of the Game Boy Advance Game Link cable, players can also go head-to-head against each other for fast-paced multiplayer action.
