In this game you play Yoh Asakura from the Shaman King japanese Manga and TV Anime series. Much like the anime and manga it is based on, is centered on Yoh Asakura and his battles to become Shaman King. The story within the game plays like a "Sidestory", referring to elements within the story of both the manga and anime while not conforming to any particular continuity. In it, Yoh's goal is to stop the Guardian of Demons from being resurrected by a gang of rogue shaman.
