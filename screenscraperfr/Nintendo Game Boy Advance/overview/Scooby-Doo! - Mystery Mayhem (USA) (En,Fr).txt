Based on the cartoon series, in the Game Boy Advance version players must lead Scooby-Doo and Shaggy through five huge episodes, exploring creepy environments such as an abandoned movie set, the ghoulish Wild West, a bayou, and a cobweb covered laboratory. They must find The Tome of Doom, capture monsters and solve the mystery, munching Scooby Snacks(TM) along the way. Platform-style game play includes outrunning monsters, searching for clues and puzzle solving.
