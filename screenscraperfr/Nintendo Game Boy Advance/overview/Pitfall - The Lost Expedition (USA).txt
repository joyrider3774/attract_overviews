Deep in the Peruvian Jungle, assume the role of Activision's classic platform hero, Pitfall Harry, a fearless, rough-and-ready treasure seeker who battles evil using his athletic ability and a knapsack filled with adventure gear. Harry competes against a rival explorer to find hidden treasures. The game features over lots of perilous levels, including lush rain forests, creature-ridden caves and vast glacial mountains. Players cross treacherous jungle terrain and dark areas filled with puzzles, tricks and traps, and -- true to the series -- swing on vines, avoid crocodiles and dodge rolling logs as they unearth artifacts and use their cunning to defeat dangerous foes.
