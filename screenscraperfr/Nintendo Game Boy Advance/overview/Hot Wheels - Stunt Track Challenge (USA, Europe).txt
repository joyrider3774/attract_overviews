Players are thrust into competition on a hot new extreme game show -- on which they must complete perilous stunts and win intense races. The goal is to beat opponents and impress the audience with fearless maneuvers, in order to advance into other episodes and win better cars. At the end of the season, the driver with the most courage and best stunt skills will cruise away in a gold-plated car as the Hot Wheels Champion. Players choose from 30 authentic Hot Wheels cars to compete in 24 stunt challenges on 12 different tracks set in environments such as Buccaneer Bay, Jurassic Jam, Zero Gravity Zone, Tiki Island, Spider Alley and Lava Land. Players can also customize their cars with unique colors, wheels and decals.
