Pokémon FireRed Version and LeafGreen Version are enhanced remakes of the original Pokémon Red and Blue video games, which were released in 1996. They were first released in Japan in January 2004 and released in North America and Europe in September and October respectively. Nearly two years after their original release, Nintendo re-marketed them as Player's Choice titles. The two games hold the distinction of being the first enhanced remakes of previous games within the franchise.
