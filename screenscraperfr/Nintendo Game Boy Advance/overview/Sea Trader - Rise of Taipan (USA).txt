Raise your sails and rouse your crew. It's time to discover new lands on the first commodities trading game for GameBoy Advance. Captain your own ship, with a band of wacky sailors at your command. Become the supreme Sea Trader as you trade in silk, grain, currency and black market goods to increase your wealth. Fight off pirates when they try to steal your goods, or even attack other ships to plunder their spoils. And when you're victorious, carousing is optional.
