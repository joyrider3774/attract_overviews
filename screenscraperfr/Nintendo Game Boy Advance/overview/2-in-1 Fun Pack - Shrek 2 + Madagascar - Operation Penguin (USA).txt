The zany penguins from Disney's MADAGASCAR: OPERATION PENGUIN movie return in Activision's MADAGASCAR: OPERATION PENGUIN for the GBA. The Penguins plot to escape from the zoo and, in the progress, rope other animal into their crazy plot. Like in the movie, the penguins want out of the New York zoo. As the game opens, the crack team of penguin escapees has put the finishing details on their escape plan, which involved digging a tunnel under the zoo and all the way to Antarctica. Of course, this isn't as easy as it sounds, and the penguins will need a number of supplies, items, and help.
