The classic word puzzle game comes to life on Game Boy Advance. Gameplay duplicates the board game to a tee: draw letters, then put them together to form words and place them on the game board. You can play a full game or try your mettle in the Quick Anagram or Conumdrum rounds. The game features an extensive word list based on the official Scrabble word list, 10 ability levels, the ability to customize the game to suit your own preferences, and single- and multiplayer game modes that let up to four Scrabble fans go head-to-head against each other.
