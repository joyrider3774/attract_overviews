The original Metroid game makes its way to the Game Boy Advance as part of the Classic NES Series. As Samus Aran, your mission is to keep space pirates from destroying the galaxy with their Metroids. To do this, you must penetrate Zebes, the pirates' home planet, while collecting special items to attack enemies in new ways. Metroid offers side-scrolling action that tests your dexterity and brings you back to classic '80s gaming.
