Dragon Ball Z: Buu's Fury begins with the Other World Tournament Saga and continues through the Kid Buu Saga, the final chapter in the Dragon Ball Z story. In a game that combines action and role-playing game elements with exploration, enemies, boss enemies, puzzles, and quests, your ultimate goal is to defeat Buu. Choose the best character Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Goten, or Trunks for each mission, create fusion characters whenever necessary, and unleash powerful attack combos and super moves.
