Much to the dismay of Jack Skellington and the citizens of Halloween Town, unusual bugs have started to infest their township. At the root of this ever-increasing bug invasion is Oogie Boogie, a former holiday king who is determined to take over Halloween. With help from his friends Sally, the mayor, and Dr. Finklestein, Jack and his trusted pal Zero embark on a quest to rid the town of bugs and stop Oogie Boogie from carrying out his evil plot. As Jack, you must battle Oogie's creepy henchmen using an arsenal of different weapons and navigate through booby traps, mazes, and puzzles.
