Bilbo the Hobbit on GBA is an action/adventure game that faithfully recreates the universe of the Lord of the Rings imagined by Tolkien. As in the book, there are hobbits, elves, goblins and all the other creatures that inhabits Middle-earth. Play as Bilbo, a young hobbit chosen by Gandalf to take back the treasure stolen by Smaug the Dragon, a long time ago, the same one who destroyed the Kingdom of the Dwarves.
