Backyard Sports Football 2007 was developed by Humongous Entertainment and published by Atari in 2006 for the Game Boy Advance. Like the previous installment in the series, Backyard Sports Football 2007 featured the ability to create your own player, build your own team, play exhibition games or a season mode, and play as a number of NFL players as their childhood lookalikes. It also added 7 on 7 gameplay for the first time.
