Based on the original SNES game, Disney's Magical Quest 2 Starring Mickey and Minnie arrives on the Game Boy Advance. As either Mickey or Minnie, you must stop the evil Baron Pete and his minions from causing trouble. During your quest, you can wear three different costumes (the Sweeper, Ranger, and Cowboy/girl) that give you unique abilities. In addition to single-player missions, the game lets you link up with your friends' Game Boy Advance for multiplayer action.
