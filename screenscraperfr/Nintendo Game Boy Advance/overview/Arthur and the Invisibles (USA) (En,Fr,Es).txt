Directly inspired by world famous film director and writer Luc Besson's upcoming animated film of the same name, the Arthur and the Minimoys game will follow the film's storyline and feature eye-popping graphics and technical innovations.

By taking a very unique approach to its presentation of the Arthur universe and utilising the unique features of the DSâ„¢ hardware, the Nintendo DSâ„¢ version of Arthur and the Minimoys is a different kind of game to the versions for other consoles and PC. Arthur and the Minimoys for DSâ„¢ gleefully portrays the magical world of Arthur through a series of original and entertaining micro games and with an absorbing 'virtual pet simulator' where players are responsible for caring for and breeding 'Mul mull', small, fluffy, flying creatures found in abundance in the world of Arthur.
