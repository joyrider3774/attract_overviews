Two games in one cartridge : Finding Nemo (The game's 12 levels follow the plot of the film. Depending on the level, the player either controls clownfish Marlin or his son Nemo. Goals in the levels might include simply finding the exit, finding certain characters or items, reaching a certain point within a time limit, or simple survival, like when Marlin and his friend Dory are chased by Bruce the shark) and The Incredibles (In the game based on the movie of the same name, you take control of Mr. Incredible when he is summoned to the island of Nomanisan for a secret assignment. The GBA version is a side-scrolling 2D beat-em-up. Initially, you can only play as Mr. Incredible but the other members of the family, along with Frozone, are playable in the later levels. The main buttons are used for basic attacks, combos and jumps, and the R button triggers special abilities known as "incredi-moves". Each member has a different special move: Mr. Incredible gets super strength, Dash runs faster, Violet has a force field and becomes invisible, and Helen can extend her arms. Using these depletes an additional meter on the screen. It is recharged by collecting icons and defeating enemies).
