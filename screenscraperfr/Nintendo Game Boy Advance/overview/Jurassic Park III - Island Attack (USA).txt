Won't these dinosaurs ever die? Refusing to succumb to extinction, the big, bad monsters of Jurassic Park return for another dino-sized adventure. Make your way through 12 levels of action, using high-tech weaponry to stalk to the prehistoric beasts before they can stalk you. Ten different species will terrorize you throughout the JURASSIC PARK locales. With graphics and play that rival coin-operated games, JURASSIC PARK III: Island Attack might just be the biggest thing to ever happen to handheld gaming.
