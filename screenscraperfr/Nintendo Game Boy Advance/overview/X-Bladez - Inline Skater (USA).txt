Get ready to race in the greatest cities of the world in countries like Britain, America, France, China, Australia and South America. Skate around the Statue of Liberty, escape from Alcatraz, get a tan on Bondi Beach, or scale the heights of The Great Wall of China. Obstacles, jumps and opposing racers bring the world and the races to life.

Unlock new environments as you progress and upgrade your skates with the money you earn. How are your wheels? Do you need to patch up those injuries with a health boost; can you afford those dream speed skates? All these will change as you progress, keeping interest in the game alive. Wheels can also be tweaked to give emphasis on speed increase & stability or maneuverability & instability, giving the player an advantage against other competitors.
