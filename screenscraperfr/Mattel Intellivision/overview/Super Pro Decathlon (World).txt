Super Pro Decathlon lets you and up to three friends compete in 10 track-and-field events. You can enter the Practice mode in order to train yourself on individual events, or you can go for broke and play the full 10-event Decathlon. Each event has a minimum time, distance, or height you must beat in order to qualify. Three difficulty levels are available: Amateur, Olympic and Super Pro.
