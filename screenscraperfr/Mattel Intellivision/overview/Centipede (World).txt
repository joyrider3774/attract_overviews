GET OUT YOUR BUG BLASTER AND SAVE THAT FUNGUS!

THE THRILL OF THE ARCADE GAME

An insidious invasion of multiplying insects (centipedes, jumping spiders, poisonous scorpions, and frenzied fleas) pose different perils to the mushroom patch. You must repeatedly blast enraged creepers and stubborn obstacles or lose your enchanted fungus. Remember to listen for the distinctive sounds of the attacking bugs; and watch out for blasted centipede segments, for each one grows a new head!
