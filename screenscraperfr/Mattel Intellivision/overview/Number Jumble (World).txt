Cut across fire in a Time Sailer, cruise under water in a Submarine, fly through thin air in a Zeppelin, or roll across the Earth in a Tank -- but never stop firing at the dreadful creatures that beset you! Shoot them down with the fireballs you control and they'll turn into black numbers. When you shoot enough creatures, you get a chance to solve exciting mathematical equations...and score big points! Hurry, for every second counts! Have fun!
