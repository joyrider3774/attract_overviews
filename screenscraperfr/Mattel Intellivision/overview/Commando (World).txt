TO: COMMANDO
FROM: COL N.K. NEWCOMBE
MISSION: CAPTURE ENEMY FORTRESS

This mission is TOP SECRET. We have to send you in ALONE against wave after wave of enemy soldiers. We can offer NO SUPPORT, except to give you a MACHINE GUN, a limited number of HAND GRENADES, and some advice:

- Keep moving! You will be under CONSTANT FIRE!
- Watch out for enemies in TRENCHES, behind BARRICADES, and on MOTORCYCLES!
- Different enemies require different strategies to defeat!
- Capture enemy stores of HAND GRENADES as you advance!
- Rescue prisoners of war!

Stay cool and maybe, just maybe, you can beat the odds. And if you succeed, we have another mission for you, TOUGHER THAN BEFORE...
