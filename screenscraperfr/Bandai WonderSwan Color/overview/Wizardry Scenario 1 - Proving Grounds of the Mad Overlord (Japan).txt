Wizardry Scenario 1 - Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord is a RPG developed and published by Sir-Tech Software in march 2003 for the WonderSwan Color.
The player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from five races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.
