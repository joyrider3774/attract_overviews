Uchuu Senkan Yamato is a Strategy game, developed by Tom Create and published by Bandai Visual in Japan in 2001.
Each of the game's 17 levels plays like an episode with text interchanges and battles (fought both in space and on various planets) that alternate between tactical moves and short cutscenes to show the results. There are also 8 new scenarios plugged in to freshen up the story with new enemies such as a hotshot Gamilas commander to rival General Lysis, a space creature or two, and the Siren of Space?a game version of the little-known manga spinoff, Eternal Story of Jura. Depending on performance and points earned, multiple endings are possible including one that incorporates the ?hologram Starsha' scene from the Yamato movie.
