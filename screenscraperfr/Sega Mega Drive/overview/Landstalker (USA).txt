A jovial fantasy yarn, Landstalker is the title that put Climax Entertainment on the map.  Following the exploits of elvish treasure hunter, Nigel, and his pixie friend, Friday, they travel to a distant island to find the long lost treasure of King Nole.

The game can draw many parallels to the Zelda series, due to the gameâ€™s mostly whimsical style and emphasis on item collecting.  However, Landstalker is more meticulous, moving at a slower and more developed rate, with an abundance of towns and NPCs rounding out the cast.
