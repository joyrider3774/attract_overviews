Ronaan, the Wizard Prince, is given the task of chasing the Engine Man (a half man, half machine entity that infiltrated the magickal Inner Realm) into a world  that has been overrun by technology.  Joined by his bodyguards, Chazz and Farrg, and his spirit guide, Indar, Ronaan joins the battle between magick and technology whose outcome will determine the fate of two dimensions.

TechnoClash is a top-down scrolling action/adventure game.  The player controls Ronaan, whose goal is to track down and defeat the Engine Man. Ronaan is accompanied by two computer-controlled bodyguards who help him in combat situations; he can scout out the tactical situation using Indar, a falcon who can fly anywhere; and he can cast spells to accomplish many tasks, including attacking his foes, teleporting out of danger, and healing himself.
