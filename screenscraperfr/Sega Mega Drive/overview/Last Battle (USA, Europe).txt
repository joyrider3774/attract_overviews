Last Battle (known in Japan as Fist of the North Star: Legend of the New Era Savior) is a 2D side-scrolling brawler developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis on July 1, 1989 (in Japan) and August 14, 1989 (in North America as a launch title).nnnnSet in the war-torn future, players take on the role of wandering Jet-Kwon-Do fighter Aarzak as he fights to reclaim his homeland from the empire of the evil Duke, only to journey to the land of the unknown to rescue one of his traveling companions, Alyssa, from three seemingly-invincible rebel generals (Gromm, Gross, and Garokk).nnnnThe original Japanese version of the game is the sequel to the 1986 Sega Master System brawler Fist of the North Star (based on the post-apocalyptic martial arts manga and anime of the same name) and details the events of the second anime series (itself the last half of the manga series). Like its predecessor, the international version of the game was localized to remove both the series's trademark extreme violence and all direct references to the source material (though its post-apocalyptic setting and plot elements remained).
