The feathers really start to fly when Flicky the Bluebird meets Tiger the treacherous cat and Iggy the instigating lizard in this zany, fun-filled arcade hit. See, it's like this: Tiger and Iggy are trying to trap the crazy Chirps.

Tiger and Iggy will stop at nothing. So hop over them. Or fling anything handy at themâ€”a tea cup, a flower pot, an apple. Then shuffle, scuttle and fly through maze after mazeâ€”dazzling ones, dark ones, silly ones, scary onesâ€”gathering up Chirps as you go. 

Lead as many Chirps as you can to safety. The more Chirps you rescue, the higher your score. And the closer you get to the BONUS ROUND where you catch catapulted Chirps with your net. So come join the fun. But don't count your chick-ens before you catch them...
