You can keep your high-tech Formula One racers and your massive Indy cars. The hottest racing cars around are smaller than a shoe box! Championship Pro-Am is a breakneck Genesis version of the action-packed, NES car racing games RC Pro-Am I and II.

Like the Pros, you whip a small radio-controlled model car around 24 tracks against four computer- controlled opponents -- and you have a blast doing it!
