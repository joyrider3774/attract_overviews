The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas is an unreleased Dreamcast racing game, developed by Full Fat and set to be published by Swing! Entertainment. It is based on the 2000 film of the same name, itself based on Hanna-Barbera's The Flintstones franchise. This Dreamcast adaptation was a kart racer, similar to others at the time, featuring various characters and environments from the movie. A notable thing is that, while based on a live-action movie, the game's look is more in line with that of the original Flintstones cartoons, as well as powerups being obtained through knocking bowling pins, also a nod towards the show.
