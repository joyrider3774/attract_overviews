Oozumou Spirits ("Sumo Spirits") is a sumo wrestling simulation game. The player creates a wrestler and improves their various stats after training and fights with other CPU sumo wrestlers. The game focuses more on realistic sumo wrestling moves and grapples rather than providing a more casual wrestling game experience.nnnnDue to the Japan-centric culture of sumo wrestling, the game was never localized.
