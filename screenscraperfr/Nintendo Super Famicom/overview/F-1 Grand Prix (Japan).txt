F-1 Grand Prix is a 1991 Formula One-based arcade racing video game developed and published by Video System exclusively in Japan. At the beginning, the player must choose between "World Grand Prix" and "Free Run" as his two different game modes. Each Grand Prix includes qualifying, in which the player must acquire the fastest lap time within a certain time limit. This results in earning a certain place on the race grid of the same Grand Prix.
