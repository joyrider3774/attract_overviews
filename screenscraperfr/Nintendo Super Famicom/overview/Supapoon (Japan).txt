Supapoon is a Super Famicom game released late in 1995 that presents a colorful world with an elastic blue hero reminiscent of a Dragon Quest slime. The hero's solar system has been invaded by a group of yellow balls wearing triangular shades, and he jumps into action to send them packing.nnSupapoon is inspired by games like Breakout and Arkanoid, but offers a few twists of its own, like being able to project the ball with additional power by using the "paddle"'s intrinsic elasticity, and a constant timer that ticks down faster whenever the paddle takes damage from skull drops or enemy attacks.
