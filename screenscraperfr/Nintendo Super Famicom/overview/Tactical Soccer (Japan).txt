Tactical Soccer is a soccer game published by Electronic Arts, although it was developed by a Japanese team.

Like Zico Soccer, the gameplay is more reminiscent of a strategy game in real time. It takes place before players' eyes so the action (which is represented by a small window at the top of the screen) can't be interrupted.

Each of the 16 national teams have 16 players with different skills (ranging from A to E). During a match, the player gives directions such as force at the center, play on the wings, back in defense, take a long or short pass. Depending on what the player chooses, it is possible to apply the command to a particular player, the player in possession of the ball, a part of the team (defense, midfield, attack) or the whole team. Everything is done relatively simply with combinations of buttons.

There are no headers, bicycle kicks or other fancy movements, scoring goals is only possible by kicking the ball. A replay is played every time a fault is committed (which happen quite often), a shot off target is made, or a goal is scored.
