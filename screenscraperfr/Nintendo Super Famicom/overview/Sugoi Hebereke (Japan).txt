Sugoi Hebereke ("Amazing Hebereke") is a 1994 competitive multiplayer arena fighter and a spin-off of the usually more puzzle-focused Hebereke series. Hebereke and his friends take to a number of different arenas to brawl each other.nnEach arena is depicted from a top-down perspective and has a mix of native obstacles and items that are carried into the arena by smaller "helper" characters. These items can make a character stronger, recover their health or even sabotage them.
