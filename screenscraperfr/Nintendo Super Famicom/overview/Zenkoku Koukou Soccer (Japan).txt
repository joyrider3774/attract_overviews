It is the first in its series of games that explores the world of high school-level competitive soccer: it was followed by 1995's Zenkoku Koukou Soccer 2.

The player picks a region of Japan and plays against local teams before they have a shot at the national competition. The pitch is depicted with a horizontal view.
