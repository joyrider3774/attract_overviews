Kidou Butouden G-Gundam ("Mobile Fighter G-Gundam") is a one-on-one fighting game for the Super Famicom which features mechs and pilots from the 1994 Kidou Botouden G-Gundam offshoot of the Gundam universe. G-Gundam is set in an alternate timeline and, instead of widespread warfare, conflicts are determined with a competitive fighting tournament.
