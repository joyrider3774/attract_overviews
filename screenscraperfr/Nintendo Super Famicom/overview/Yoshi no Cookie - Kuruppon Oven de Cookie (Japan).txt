This special edition of Yoshi's Cookie was limited to a number of 500 cartridges and included with National Human Electronics' new Kuruppon oven. While it includes an entire copy of the SNES version of Yoshi's Cookie, it also includes an additional mode where Yoshi explores an overworld and teaches the player recipes of real-life versions of the cookies in the game.
