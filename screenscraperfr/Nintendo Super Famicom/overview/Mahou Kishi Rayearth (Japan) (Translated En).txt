A turn-based RPG that is based on the manga/anime of the same name, featuring three schoolgirls who are transported from modern day Tokyo to the magical world of Cephiro. The game loosely follows the plot of the manga and anime, wherein the heroines determine how Cephiro works and their role in rescuing the world's leader Princess Emeraude, who presently takes the vital role of Pillar, from the villainous Zagato.
