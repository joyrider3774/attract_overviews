Nintama Rantarou Special ("Ninja Boy Rantarou Special") is an action-platformer game with a few different modes. It is also the fourth Super Famicom game to be based on the Nintama Rantarou manga and anime license, and most closely resembles the first game.nnnnThe game's story mode has the player move from character to character while cutscenes play, with some gameplay sequences to break it up. Shinbei's first sequence starts as an adventure game, and segues to a runaway horse sequence, while Rantarou and Kirimaru progress through side-scrolling levels. Rantarou can use a grappling hook to cross large gaps, while Kirimaru can climb mossy walls.
