Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu '94 is a baseball sim and the first in Konami's long-running Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu series, or simply Power Pro. It is the first of six Super Famicom games in the franchise. The game is reminiscent of Namco's Famista series, especially with the cartoonish super-deformed athletes. As well as the usual exhibition and pennant modes, the player can practice any position in the game (batting, pitching, fielding) with any team member.

As with most games in the Power Pro series, Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu '94 was never released outside of Japan.
