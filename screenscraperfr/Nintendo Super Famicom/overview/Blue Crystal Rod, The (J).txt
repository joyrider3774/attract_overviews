The Blue Crystal Rod is the final game in the main The Tower of Druaga series. It is actually the third chapter in The Tower of Druaga series, as The Quest of Ki was a prequel ("Chapter 0"). The game is a first-person dungeon crawler action role-playing game, somewhat akin to games like Shining in the Darkness or Shin Megami Tensei.
