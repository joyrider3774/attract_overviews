Koushien 4 is the fourth game in Magical Company's Koushien series of baseball sims that focus on Japan's highschool-aged national tournament that culminates in the eponymous stadium, and the final game in the series to be released on the Super Famicom.

The player can once again pick a region in any prefecture and coach that team through the regional knock-out phase to the nationals. The game offers the focal tournament mode and a versus mode that allows two human players to clash on the diamond, or up to four players working in teams.
