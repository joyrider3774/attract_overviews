The sequel to J-League Super Soccer (Virtual Soccer on Western editions), and like that game contains the real teams of Division 1 of the J-League. Rather than UK developer Probe Entertainment, who developed the original, Hudson employed A.I Co. to create the game. The game was followed with J-League '96 Dream Stadium the following year. J-League Super Soccer '95 offered multiple vantage points for the game, either a top-down view or a slanted view that was closer to the ground, and also had separate chants for each of the fourteen teams that occupied the J-League during the 1995 season.
