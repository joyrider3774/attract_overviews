Chibi Maruko-Chan: Mezase! Minami no Island!! ("Chibi Maruko-Chan: Take Aim! South Island!!") is an anime licensed game based on Chibi Maruko-Chan, a slice-of-life manga about a grade-schooler, her friends and her family.

The game is a loose collection of different mini-games and utilities intended for a younger audience, a dodgeball game set on a Bomberman grid, a painting game that plays like competitive Snake, and a sumo-like game on a floating platform in a pool.  It also features a single-player story mode, in which interstitial text-heavy story cutscenes set the stage for the mini-games, as well as modes that let up to four players try each mini-game directly.
