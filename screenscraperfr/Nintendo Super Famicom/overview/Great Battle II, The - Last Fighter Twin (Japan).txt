The second game in the Great Battle series for Super Famicom which began with SD Great Battle in 1990. It is also part of the Compati Hero Series, which re-imagines Gundam, Ultraman and Kamen Rider characters as super deformed (SD) versions of relative sizes. This was so the immensely tall Gundam and Ultraman characters could fight alongside human-sized Kamen Rider characters.

Last Fighter Twin departs from SD Great Battle's top-down action gameplay with a side-scrolling brawler format.
