This video game is the third title in Video System's licensed F1 Grand Prix series, which is based on the 1993 Formula One season. It was licensed by Fuji Television and FOCA. It is also the first title in the series to be released exclusively to a home console, which was released for the Super Famicom exclusively in Japan on April 22, 1994. All the teams and drivers of the 1993 season are represented except the three-time world champion Ayrton Senna, whose name was not included with the F1 licence. However the player can create a driver with a graphic representation of Senna's face. It is also possible to compete in the 1991 and 1992 Formula One season.
