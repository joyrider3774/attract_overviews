The action is once again presented in an isometric ring, and players must use timing-based button presses to effectively grapple and pin their opponents. The player can choose from a number of wrestlers, many of whom are from international circuits like the WWE and WCW, who are all homages to actual wrestlers under different names. The player could also make their own wrestler in the game's "create-a-wrestler" editor mode, a series staple.
