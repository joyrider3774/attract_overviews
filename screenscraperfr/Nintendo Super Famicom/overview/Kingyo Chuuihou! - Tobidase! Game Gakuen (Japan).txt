Kingyo Chuuihou! Tobidase! Game Gakuen ("Goldfish Warning! Leap Out! Game Academy!") is a multiplayer party game based on the Kingyo Chuuihou! (Goldfish Warning!) manga and anime. The anime is about a rich girl named Chitose who loses her fortune and is forced to enroll in a public rural school that accepts barnyard animals as students. The anime charts her attempts to refine/gentrify those around her, including her new best friend Wapiko (the pink-haired girl on the cover/title screen).

The game allows for up to three players. Each "mini-game" is selected from a roulette, and players compete to earn 100 points the quickest. These mini-games can range from trivia contests to more action-oriented fare. Most mini-games have their own rules concerning gaining (and losing) points to pay attention to.

Kingyo Chuuihou! Tobidase! Game Gakuen was released on the Super Famicom in 1994 and was never released outside of Japan. It is the only Kingyo Chuuihou game on the Super Famicom: the other two were created for the Nintendo Game Boy prior to this game.
