SD Gundam Power Formation Puzzle is a licensed puzzle game based on the SD Gundam setting, which in turn is a spin-off from the Gundam universe. It is exclusive to the Super Famicom. It features a story mode, a time trial mode and a versus mode for multiplayer.nnThe puzzle game involves stacking colored blocks in rows across the bottom of the screen. When four blocks of the same color are adjacent to each other, though not necessarily in a straight horizontal or vertical line, they are destroyed and disappear. Placing four differently-colored blocks in a row will also cause them disappear.
