Zen Nippon Pro Wrestling is a wrestling game based on the Zen-Nippon Pro Wrestling league and features the likeness of their most famous stars at the time.

Following the template laid by the classics of the genre, the game casts you as any of the 16 wrestling stars and then throws you to the ring to grapple the hell out of your opponent until one of you emerges victorious. You can attack your opponent with several moves (unique to each character) and upon "locking-on" by getting too close to the other wrestler you can execute grapples and throws.

The game uses 2D graphics from a heightened camera view and includes a plethora of game modes including single player Championship and Tournament modes (with single or Tag variants for both), 2 Player Vs., Team Battle, and a Training in which you can learn the basics of the game.
