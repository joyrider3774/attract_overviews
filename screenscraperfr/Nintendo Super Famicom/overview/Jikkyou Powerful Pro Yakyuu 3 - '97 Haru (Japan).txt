Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 3 '97-Haru ("Live Commentary Powerful Pro Baseball 3 '97 Spring") is the eighth game in the Powerful Pro series, and the last (of five) to be released on the Super Famicom. It iterates on the third game with a roster update for Spring of 1997, but is otherwise identical to Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 3. '97-Haru was released after the true sequel Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 4, which was an N64 exclusive that came out just a week earlier.

The game features a lot of voicework - hence the Jikkyou, or "Live Commentary" - and represents its characters as large-headed cartoon characters. These are series staples, and persist to the modern entries.
