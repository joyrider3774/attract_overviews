Nintama Rantarou 3 ("Ninja Boy Rantarou 3") is an action-platforming game for the Super Famicom and the fifth game on the system to use the Nintama Rantarou license, based on a comedic children's manga and anime about a trio of ninja cadets. As with its predecessors, the game balances 2D platforming sections that relies on the trio's ninja skills with cutscenes and mini-games.

The game breaks up the game into sequences which the player can tackle in a semi-loose order. The grid of possible skits and stages to visit is limited at first, and more become available as others are completed.
