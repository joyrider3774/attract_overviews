Kat's Run: Zennihon K Car Senshuken ("Kat's Run: All-Japan K Car Championship") is a mode 7 racing game for the Super Famicom that features kei cars: a smaller weight/size category of vehicle in Japan that includes microvans and convertibles. The single-player mode has one of ten female drivers competing to win a street racing tournament. A small window allows players to see their driver's expression, which changes when turning or whenever she overtakes or gets overtaken by an opponent.

Similar to Super Mario Kart, the multiplayer mode includes items and unusual courses which can also include jumps and pitfalls.
