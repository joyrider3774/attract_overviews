Uchuu Race: Astro Go! Go! ("Uchuu" means "Space") is a Mode 7 enhanced racing game from KAZe and Meldac that is similar to F-Zero. The player can choose one of five racers: the elfin Jet and Love, the skeletal Bari, the bat-like Flyhigh and the robot E-O. The courses tend to be filled with obstacles and tricks, such as currents that carry the player in one direction or jumps over empty space.

The game was planned for a US release named Freeway Flyboys but was canceled mid-development.
