Puzzle'N Desu! is a block-pushing puzzle game for the Super Famicom developed and published by Nihon Bussan, a.k.a. Nichibutsu. The protagonist's village is suddenly attacked one day by a demonic presence that drops hundreds of colored blocks on the panicked citizens. The hero decides to fight back by removing them all and defeating the demon.nnnnThe game is a combination of Puzznic and Sokoban/Boxxle. In order to remove these blocks, they need to be lined up with blocks of a similar color. Pushing a block causes it to keep moving until it either hits another block or a wall. The stage can only be completed if every block is removed, so the player needs to be careful not to leave remainders: while lines of three are sufficient, if there's four or five blocks of the same color the player needs to figure out how to line them all up at the same time.
