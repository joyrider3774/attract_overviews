Super Professional Baseball II is a TOSE/Jaleco baseball simulator and the sequel to Super Professional Baseball (Super Bases Loaded). Super Bases Loaded 2 is actually based on a separate Jaleco baseball game named Super 3D Baseball, instead of this game. Super Professional Baseball II was never released in the US or Europe.nnnnSuper Professional Baseball II uses the same angled viewpoint as its predecessor while batting/pitching, to ensure both the batter and pitcher are clearly visible. Small animations play whenever a batter reaches a base just as the ball flies in, allowing the player to see clearly whether or not the batter is actually "safe" or "out".
