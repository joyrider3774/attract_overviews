World Class Rugby 2: Kokunai Gekitou Hen '93 ("Home Intense Fighting Chapter") is a rugby game for the Super Famicom and the sequel to World Class Rugby. Unlike its predecessor, it was never released outside of Japan. Misawa, the publishers, based this sequel on Denton Designs' code for the original.nnnnThe subtitle refers to the fact that all the teams are national Japanese teams, rather than featuring teams from across the world.
