Sanrio Shanghai is a mahjong solitaire licensed game that uses the world of Sanrio characters, such as Hello Kitty, KeroKeroKeroppi and others, for the various tiles that the player must remove. The game features a few modes: a single-player, and two competitive two-player modes. One of these multiplayer modes involves alternating turns, while the other has each player solve as much of the grid as possible within a time limit before switching over.
