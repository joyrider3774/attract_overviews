J-League Soccer: Prime Goal 2 is a video game licensed by J-League, published by Namco. It is the second game in the J-League Soccer Prime Goal series, preceded by J-League Soccer: Prime Goal and succeeded by 90 Minutes: European Prime Goal. Prime Goal 2 was released on August 5, 1994 only in Japan for the Super Famicom.

Other than running around, shooting, passing, and slide-tackling, the player has control over several other actions. Naturally, there are throw ins (the player can select which team member to throw the ball to), goal kicks (where the player controls the distance the ball is kicked), fouls (referees even dole out yellow and red cards), and occasionally a one-on-one minigame. In this one-on-one game the player can either manage to relinquish control of the ball from the opponent, or have the opponent jump over the player (depending on the player's button inputs).

Of note are the variety of modes that are offered in Prime Goal 2. Naturally, there is a player vs. computer and player vs. player mode, but also included are a campaign mode (complete with a password system), a penalty kick mode, and an "east vs. west" mode where the player is able to consolidate members from several teams into one, customized team.
