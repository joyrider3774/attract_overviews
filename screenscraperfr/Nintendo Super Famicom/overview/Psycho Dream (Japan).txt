Psycho Dream is a side-scrolling action game with light platforming elements, similar in style to Valis games, though less story-driven. The game is set in predominantly modern-day environments. The player can choose to control either Ryo Shizima or Maria Tobari, two demon hunters who must save an innocent girl named Sayaka and rid the world of rampaging monsters. The two protagonists share the same stages; only single-player mode is available.nnnnBoth demon hunters rely mostly on close-range attacks - Ryo with a sword, Maria with a whip, though they can also use guns. Most of the gameplay consists of slowly walking through monster-infested areas, eliminating enemies and avoiding obstacles, which often requires jumping and ducking. Power-ups are obtained from fallen foes. Depending on their color, these power-ups can increase the attack level of a weapon, envelop the character in a protective force field, or restore his/her health. Rare red power-ups are unique to each character: Ryo dons a special armor that hits enemies with bouncing lasers, while Maria gets in touch with her angelic nature, growing wings and firing homing energy balls.
