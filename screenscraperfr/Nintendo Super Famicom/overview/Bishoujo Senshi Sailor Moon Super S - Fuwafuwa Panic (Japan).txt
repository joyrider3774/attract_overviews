Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Super S: Fuwa Fuwa Panic ("Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon Super S: Floating Panic") is a puzzle game licensed by Bandai that features the various Sailor Guardians, including the new "super" transformations of Usagi Tsukino (Sailor Moon) and Chibi-usa (Sailor Chibi Moon) that debuted in the "Super S" season, which was the name of the fourth season of the anime adaptation.nnnnThe goal of the game is to fire at the balloons that appear at the top of the screen to pop them. By shooting a balloon adjacent to another of the same color, the player pops both simultaneously. By popping a large number of balloons simultaneously, they can create trash for the other player to clear - these appear as gray balloons that can't easily be popped directly but disappear when multiple balloons are popped near them.nnnnThe player can select between nine Sailor Guardians in the vs. mode (all except Saturn), but is restricted to Sailors Moon, Chibi Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter and Venus for the single-player story mode. Sailor Saturn appears in-game as an advisor, but is not playable. The game was followed by a sequel the following year: Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Super S: Fuwa Fuwa Panic 2. It also received a fan translation in 2016.
