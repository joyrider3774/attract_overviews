A behind-the-car driving game exclusive. Named after and endorsed by Keiichi "Drift King" Tsuchiya, and the title refers to the Shuto Expressway near Tokyo upon which most of the races take place. Players select a car and customize it before taking it to the track to race against other street racing enthusiasts. The game maintains a split-screen regardless of whether or not a second player is involved; on single-player, the top screen's camera stays on the starting line.



The game is the sequel to Drift King Shutouku Battle '94. Genki would continue the Shutokou Battle series beyond the Super Famicom with PlayStation entries like Tokyo Highway Battle and the Tokyo Xtreme Racer series for Dreamcast and PS2.
