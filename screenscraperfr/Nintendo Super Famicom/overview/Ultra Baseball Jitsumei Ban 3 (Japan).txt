Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban 3 ("Real Name Ultra Baseball 3") is the sixth game in Culture Brain's Baseball Simulator 1.000/Ultra Baseball series. As with the previous two "Jitsumeiban" games, the players and teams are all taken from the official Nippon Professional Baseball league during the 95/96 season, and many of them appear in the intro and on the box art as caricatures.nnnnThe game features team customization options as well as standard exhibition, tournament and all-star modes. Every mode in the game offers the option of a CPU vs. CPU match if the player simply wants to watch a simulated game.nnnnThe game also features the series's trademark "Ultra" teams, which are fictional teams/athletes that can call upon superpowers to increase their prowess as batters, pitchers and fielders.
