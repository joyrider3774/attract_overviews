Isozuri: Ritou Hen ("Rock Fishing: Island Edition", where Isozuri specifically refers to standing on a rocky coastline while casting out to sea) is a fishing game exclusive to the Super Famicom. The player travels around an archipelago finding a place to start angling, catching different ocean fish depending on the location and the time of day.

The game was one of many fishing simulators developed by Pack-In-Video for the console. Players had a limited selection of bait and lures they could switch between depending on the available fish.
