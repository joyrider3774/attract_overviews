Super Famista 5 is the fourteenth game in Namco's Famista (short for Family Stadium) series of baseball sims and the final to be released for the Super Famicom. Like its predecessors, it uses super-deformed versions of athletes and features real teams from the Nippon Professional Baseball League.nnnnFuture entries would move to the N64 briefly and then stay on Nintendo's portables, from GBA to DS to 3DS.
