New Yatterman: Nandai Kandai Yajirobee is a multiplayer-focused game for the Super Famicom that is based on the 1970s Yatterman anime franchise.nnnnYatterman features a team of three heroes, all called Yatterman, who attempt to beat the supervillain team Doronbo (also a group of three) to a set of skull coins which will reveal the way to a giant treasure horde. The heroes often use toys and mechs to defeat their incompetent opponents, such as the male protagonist's kendamagic.nnnnThe game is similar to First Star's Spy vs. Spy series, in that both teams are attempting to reach the treasure first. They can trip up their opponents via a number of traps, some of which have conditional uses. By burying mines and setting off missiles, the player can whittle down the health of their opponents as well as keep them off their tracks. If the two teams meet, they fight each other in a three-on-three tag team battle with the losing side taking a large hit to their health. The game can be played single-player (as either the Yatterman team or the Doronbo team) or multiplayer.
