Home version of the 1979 arcade game. Players launch missiles from the bottom of the screen at enemy spacecraft located at the top. The missile must pass through a asteroid belt flying across the screen and avoid the shots being fired from the spacecraft. The player controls the missile. Once launched it can be moved left and right and can be sped up by using the boost to speed it's way out of trouble. Points scored depend on the location of the hit on the enemy spacecraft. The speed at which enemy spacecraft moves increases as their numbers decrease.


 Once all spacecrafts have been destroyed another wave starts. The speed decreases again and the process repeats. A life is lost when a missile is hit by a shot or collides with an asteroid. There are 3 game modes. Black & white and color recreate the graphics and behavior of the original arcade game, whilst Neo mode updates the game with improved graphics and slightly different behavior. There's also a turn-based two player mode. Other options include changing the number of lives available at the start of a game and the number of points needed for an extra ship.
