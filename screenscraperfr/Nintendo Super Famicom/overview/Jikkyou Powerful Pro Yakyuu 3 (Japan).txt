Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 3 is the third major game in the Powerful Pro series. This game was released on February 29, 1996 for the Super Famicom only in Japan by Konami. The game was developed by Diamond Head, a developer behind many Jikkyou Powerful Pro games. Powerful Pro 3 is a traditional baseball simulator, in the "super deformed" or "chibi" style that makes the franchise well-known.

The game is fairly similar to its predecessors, Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu '94 and Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2, although it does add some new features, such as Success Mode. Success Mode is an RPG-esque mode where players develop a baseball player, guiding them through situations and forming them into a "powerful pro."

The real draw of the Powerful Pro series is the Success Mode, which was started with this game. It puts the player in control of a pre-made character who the player must develop into a powerful athlete. This is done by guiding the player through situations, making decisions, etc. As a more "role-playing game"-esque part of the game, this actually provides players with multiple save slots and options.
