Masters: Harukanaru Augusta 3 is a behind-the-back golf simulation game developed and published by T&E Soft originally for the 3DO exclusively in Japan on July 9, 1994. It was later ported to the Super Famicom in 1995 as Masters New: Harukanaru Augusta 3. Like the original version, none of these ports were released outside of Japan.
