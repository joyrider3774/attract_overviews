Zero-4 Champ RR-Z is a drag racing game for the Super Famicom and the sequel to 1994's Zero-4 Champ RR. As with that game, the goal is to race 400m drag races by quickly accelerating and switching gears to outpace the opponent. It is part of the larger Zero-4 Champ series, which first began on the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 with 1991's Zero-4 Champ.nnnnThe game also features three distinct modes: a story mode, that intersperses its racing with dialogue-heavy cutscenes and adventure game elements; a versus mode for one or more players; and a "ministory" mode that has much less plot between races and no adventure elements.
