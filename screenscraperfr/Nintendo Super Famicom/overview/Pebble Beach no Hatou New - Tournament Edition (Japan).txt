Pebble Beach no Hotou New: Tournament Edition ("The Waves of Pebble Beach New: Tournament Edition") is a golfing game from T&E Soft that skews towards the more serious golfing simulation aspect, and uses digitized photos for both its golfers and its courses.nnnnThe game is a sequel to 1992's Pebble Beach Links, part of their realistic "True Golf Sims" series. It again features the namesake golf course of Pebble Beach, California.
