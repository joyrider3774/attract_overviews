Super Gachapon World: SD Gundam X is a strategy game that features super deformed Mobile Suit Gundam characters fighting each other in turn-based skirmishes. Gachapon refers to capsule machines: "Gachapon" is the Japanese onomatopoeia of a crank turning and a toy capsule dropping. The game is so named because new units are acquired by turning the crank on enormous capsule machines.nnnnThe game is a pseudo-sequel to SD Gundam World: Gachapon Senshi: Scramble Wars for the Famicom.
