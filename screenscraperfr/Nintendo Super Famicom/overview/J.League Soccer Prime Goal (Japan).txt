J-League Soccer: Prime Goal is a soccer game based on the J-League, Japan's premier soccer league. It uses a horizontally scrolling soccer pitch that occasionally cuts to cinematic animations for challenges and after a goal is scored. The player has the choice of ten teams in the J League, each with the real-life members of each team (at the time).

The game was followed with two more sequels for the Super Famicom: J-League Soccer: Prime Goal 2 and J-League Soccer: Prime Goal 3. The third game is the only one to be released outside of Japan, as 90 Minutes: European Prime Goal.
