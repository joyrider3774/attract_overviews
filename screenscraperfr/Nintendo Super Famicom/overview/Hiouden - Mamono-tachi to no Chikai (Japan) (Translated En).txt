A real-time strategy RPG that is depicted from an isometric perspective. The game was developed originally for the PC-9801 computer in 1992 and was then ported to the Super Famicom in 1994.The story concerns the young Crown Prince Richard A. McIntyre (who would eventually be known as the Scarlet King) who is chased from his home by demons. He meets a dryad spirit who bestows to him the ability to summon and control monsters and other creatures, and Prince Richard uses this power to raise an army to take back his castle.The Super Famicom is one of a handful to use the SNES Mouse peripheral as many of its mechanics depend on mouse control.
