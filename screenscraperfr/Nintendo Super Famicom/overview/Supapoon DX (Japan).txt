Supapoon DX is specifically an enhanced remake of 1995's Supapoon. It uses the same world map but features different levels and power-ups. It also includes an intro cutscene for the single-player game and, most overtly, introduces a competitive two-player versus mode. The two-player mode gives each player their own screen of blocks to eliminate, and various power-ups are meant to make the game more challenging for their opponent, such as an arrow that drops the opponent's blocks down a space.
