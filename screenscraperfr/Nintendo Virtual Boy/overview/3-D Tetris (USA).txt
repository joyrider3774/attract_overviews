3D Tetris is a 3D Tetris game on Virtual Boy with 3 modes. The first contains five layers of Tetris blocks. Each time you complete a layer the blocks fall, disappear and you'll be rewarded with points. In the second, you place the blocks around the center of a well, the aim being to make them disappear. In the third mode, a form will be posted before the start of the match. You will have to reproduce that form perfectly.
