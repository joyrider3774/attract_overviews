Neo Cherry Master is a virtual slot machine simulator for the Neo Geo Pocket. The game simulates the old fashioned fruit-matching slots (infamously known as one-armed bandits), where the player simply "pulls the lever" and leaves the rest up to chance. The game features two modes, Simple and Original mode, with the only difference being that the latter allows for name entry and the ability to save high scores.
