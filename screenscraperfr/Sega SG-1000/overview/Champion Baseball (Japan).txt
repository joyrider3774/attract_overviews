Champion Baseball is an arcade baseball game developed by ADK. Sega distributed the game worldwide, and produced an SG-1000 port in 1983. Alpha Denshi also made a sequel, only released in arcades.

Champion Baseball is said to have been a hugely successful arcade game in Japan, even receiving its own dedicated parlours in the country (of the sort first seen with Space Invaders in 1978).
