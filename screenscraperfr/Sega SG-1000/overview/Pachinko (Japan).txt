Pachinko is an SG-1000 game developed and published by Sega in 1983. It is, as the name suggests, a video game version of Pachinko, a popular game in Japan. The game did not see an international release.

Pachinko is an extremely rare game for the SG-1000. Soon after release, it was recalled from sale due to a game-breaking bug (need to verify) and very few copies remain in the hands of collectors. This is probably the very first instance of a recall in Sega's history (?).
