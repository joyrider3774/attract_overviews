A red formula car travelling at high speed through the streets, speeding up, jumping, maneuvering to the right and left to avoid the cars obstructing the way and reckless cars coming close to your machine, ........ Be on the lookout for an ambulance suddenly passing by ......... And keep an eye out for the signposts!! Thrill-packed challenges such as the slip zones, dangerous construction sites as well as sharp curves and narrow bay bridges also appear.
