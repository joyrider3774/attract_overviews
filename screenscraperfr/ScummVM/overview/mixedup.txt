This interactive adventure introduces children ages 3 to 6 to the world of computers while teaching them logic, organization and memory skills. Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep; the cat's lost his fiddle; there's lots of trouble in Mother Goose Land and it's up to you to help out. The child reunites 18 delightful animated characters with their lost items. In return, each character performs a song complete with animation and text. Learning the classic nursery rhymes has never been so easy and fun!
The game was remade several times. It was first remade in 1990, using Sierra SCI engine with both EGA and VGA graphics, supporting sound cards and modules. In 1995 it was again remade as Mixed-Up Mother Goose Deluxe, featuring SVGA graphics, digitized music and voice, and a host of new features.
