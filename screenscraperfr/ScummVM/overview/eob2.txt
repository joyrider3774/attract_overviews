Through a clearing in the haunted forest, three massive towers rise into the night sky - the dread Temple Darkmoon is just ahead! Like a siren, it inexorably draws you into its nightmarish depths...

The exciting sequel to Eye of the Beholder is here! Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon is a graphically based AD&D computer fantasy role-playing saga. You'll love the stunning pictures, realistic animation and 3-D "you-are-there" point of view.
