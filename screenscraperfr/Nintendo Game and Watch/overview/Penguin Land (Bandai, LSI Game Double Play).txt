The iceberg stands between the teams. * Rules for the war: A vulture throws two bombs into the playground. The vulture cycles through the playgrounds.

You can keep it as much time as you wish. Press the Start/Attack button to throw the bomb back to your opponent. Both the penguin and the seal standing over the iceberg will send the bomb. back immediately. They move randomly. If the vulture catches a flying bomb, he will throw it into the opposite playground. Sometimes an ice block comes from the sea; you will collect it by catching it (move on it and then press the Start/Attack button) and then taking it to the opposite side of the playground. By collecting three ice blocks your team will be able to reach the fish over the iceberg and eat some of it. This will cost two points to your opponent team. If you're bombed while keeping an ice block in your hands, you'll lose it. * Aim of the game: you win the game by decreasing your opponent's score to 0. 1 point - bombing your opponent. 2 points - collecting three ice blocks.
