Donkey Kong juggles pineapples while balancing on a barrel. Catch the pineapples, but beware of fireballs. Donkey Kong will automatically toss the pineapples he catches. Mario watches his juggling performance. Lives are lost either if a pineapple falls on the floor or if Donkey Kong touches a fireball. Mario laughs at Donkey Kong as he misses. Three misses and game ends. 1 point for each pineapple Donkey Kong catches and tosses. Maximum displayed score is 999. At 300 points fanfare sounds and all misses are canceled. If there are no misses when 300 points are reached, game goes into "Chance-Time": all points are awarded at double value (2 points per pineapple caught) until a miss is made.
