Mario is in the jungle, fighting against an enemy army. His aim is to take five bombs on the right side of the jungle. Mario's companion on the right side places bombs close to enemies. When all five bombs are in place, they detonate and enemy army is beaten. Enemies try to light Mario's bomb; lift/lower Mario's bomb to keep it safe. If enemies torches reach Mario's bomb, all progress (bombs already placed) is lost. Three misses and game ends. 1 point when Mario steps forward. 5 points when Mario places a bomb. 10 points when Mario places the 5th bomb. At 300 points a music is played and all misses are canceled; if there are no misses when 300 points are reached game goes into "Chance-Time": score flashes and all points are awarded at double value until miss is made. Maximum displayed score is 999 points. At 999 points score resets and game starts again (at higher speed).
