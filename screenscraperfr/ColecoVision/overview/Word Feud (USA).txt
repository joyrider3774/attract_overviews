Victory doesn't always belong to the fastest player in WORD FEUD. It's not enough to quickly find a likely word match in the maze and move your window over it. You must also be sure that it is the right word and that means finding the other copy! Remember ? even if you think you've found the right word. it might not he the one you want because in each round there is always decoy word there to confuse you The decoy word can even he the same word as the one hidden, but with different colors!
