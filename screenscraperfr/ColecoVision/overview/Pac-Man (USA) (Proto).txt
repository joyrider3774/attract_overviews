The refinements of dot choming lead to high scores as hungry Pac-Man avoids ambush by voracious goblins.
When Pac-Man gulps an energy dot, he can turn the tables and eat everything in sight...

That includes yummy bonus nuggets, sending scores into the thousqands.

and soon become their old selves, fast and sneaky, to try to put an end to Pac-Man's three lives.
