Wee Willie is a window washer at an apartment who wants to keep his customers happy. Some of the customers welcome him and want their windows washed while others are worrisome about his wet work and would not want him washing their windows. There's only so much water for Willie to wield in his bucket, so he must only waste it on the welcoming window wash customers. It's also raining so Willie will have to remember who lives where.
