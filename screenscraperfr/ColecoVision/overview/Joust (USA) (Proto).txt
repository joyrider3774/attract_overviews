Survival is the name of the game in this alien arena!

Never in your wildest dreams did you ever imagine you would be one day riding an ostrich in an alien arena, fighting for your life against other vulture-riding gladiators. And yet, there you are, and your only concern now is survival! Direct your ostrich around the arena and hit your opponents from above to turn them into eggs you can collect for extra points. If they hatch before you can grab them, they will come back into the fight stronger than before. Also watch out for the Pterodactyl who will appear randomly when you least expect it, and avoid the scorching lava pits below. How long can you last in the Joust?
