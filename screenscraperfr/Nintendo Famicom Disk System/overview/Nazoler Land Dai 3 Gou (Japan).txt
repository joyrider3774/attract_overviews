Nazoler Land Dai 3 Gou was the third and final "Magazine Disk" published by Sunsoft for the Famicom Disk System. This last disk was released in 1988. The full title of the disk is Nazo no Magazine Disk Nazoler Land Dai 3 Gou which translates as "Puzzle Magazine Disk Nazoler Land 3rd Issue." Rather than featuring one game, it contains a collection of 6 games which would be considered "mini-games." The player selects which game to play from the menu screen.
