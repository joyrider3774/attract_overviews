Nazoler Land Dai 2 Gou was the second of three "Magazine Disks" published by Sunsoft for the Famicom Disk System in the middle of 1987. The full title of the disk is Nazo no Magazine Disk Nazoler Land Dai 2 Gou which translates as "Puzzle Magazine Disk Nazoler Land 2nd Issue." Rather than featuring one game, it contains a collection of 6 games which would be considered "mini-games." The player selects which game to play from the menu screen.
