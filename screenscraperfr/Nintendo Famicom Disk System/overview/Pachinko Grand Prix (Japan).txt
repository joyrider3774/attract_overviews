Pachinko GP (or Pachinko Grand Prix) is a Pachinko simulator from Data East for the Famicom Disk System. The goal is to play Pachinko in various machines found in Pachinko parlors across Japan, attempting to reach a Pachinko ball target (the total grows each time the player successfully fires a ball into a point-scoring zone) before a time limit expires before they move onto the next machine.
