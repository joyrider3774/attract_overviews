The game stars the twin Bubble Dragons Bub and Bob in an action-platform game in which players travel through one hundred different stages, busting and pushing bubbles, avoiding enemies and collecting a variety of items. The main goal of the game is to rescue Bub and Bob's girlfriends from monsters. In the game, each player controls one of the two Bubble Dragons, Bub and Bob. The player can move along platforms, as well as jump to those above and to the side, similar to most platform games. The dragons can blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. The bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated.
