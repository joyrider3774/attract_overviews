In the time the last game, strange things have happened at the town of Dorl. A proclamation was made that Ruu has been resurrected. The people gathered in the temple to pray, until the swordsman Ral had been summoned by the heavens to enter the castle and fight Ruu.

Like it's prequel the game takes place in a 3D dungeon crawling environment only this time there is a tower to conquer as well as a dungeon. Battles also happen in real-time so if you idle too long you will quickly be attacked. However once you reach certain levels enemies will no longer randomly attack you.
