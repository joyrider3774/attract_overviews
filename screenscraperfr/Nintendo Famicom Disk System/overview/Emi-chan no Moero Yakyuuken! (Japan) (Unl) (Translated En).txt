It's a strip janken game. Janken's just a fancy Japanese word for rock-paper-scissors I think, but janken's easier to type. The whole ?strip? part of the game is, for every match you lose, you take off an article of clothing. Woo! For every match you win, Emi (the girl you play against) takes off an article of clothing. WOO! For every match you tie, Emi puts back on an article of clothing. WHAT?! Yeah, it's a pirate game, no one said it had to be fair.nnnnWhat's even more unfair is, once you get Emi down to like, four articles of clothing, you have to win three times against various barnyard animals. Win three times against a barnyard animal, win against Emi, she loses another article of clothing. Win three MORE times against another barnyard animal, win against Emi, she loses another article of clothing. So yeah, the match is pretty easily stacked in her favor, wouldn't you say? Too bad you don't have any mammals lying around to protect YOU in your strip janken game.nnnnSo yeah, just use up and down to cycle through the different hands, and hit A to choose what you want. Yeah, really complicated.
