A magic red jewel known as the Almana is stolen from an unnamed village. A thief runs off with the jewel and turns the entire village into stone. The player takes the role of Kaito a hero who resembles Indiana Jones and must travel through six cavernous levels in search of the lost jewel. Kaito's main source of transportation is unique. Besides just walking and jumping, like most platform games, he must also use a special grappling hook to reach platforms that are too high. To make things a little more difficult, the grappling hook can only be launched from a diagonal direction and not just straight above.
