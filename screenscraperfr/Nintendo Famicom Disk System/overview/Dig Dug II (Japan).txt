Unlike the first game, Dig Dug II takes place on an island with an overhead view. The goal is simple: to kill all the enemies on the round. There are two types of enemies; Pookas (the round red monsters with goggles) only have the power to kill a player by touching him, but Fygars (the dragons) have the power to kill a player either by touching him or horizontally breathing fire to burn him.
