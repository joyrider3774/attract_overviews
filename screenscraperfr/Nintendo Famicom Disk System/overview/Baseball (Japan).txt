A re-release for the Famicom Disk System in 1986 of Nintendo's Famicom Baseball. As in real baseball, the object of the game is to score the most runs. Up to two players are supported. Each player can select from one of six teams. Although there is no difference between them other than uniform color, they are meant to represent the six members of the Japanese Central League.
