Fallen Angels is a two dimensional fighting game that takes a somewhat realistic approach in its gameplay, with no supernatural attacks and fluid movements animated using real motions. Projectile attacks are limited to three characters, atypical for the game's genre. The game featured eight playable characters: Cool, Harry Ness, Yuiren, Yuiran, Tar≈ç, Torao Onigawara, Ruccio Roche, Haiji Mibu. The boss characters are Trigger and Carlos.

The game takes place in 2010, ten years after a massive earthquake that shook an unnamed city. The earthquake severed the city from its surrounding areas, leaving criminals to run as they please. The game revolves around the inhabitants fighting against one another to accomplish their goals.
