Clutch Hitter is a baseball game originally released for Sega System 18 hardware before being ported to the Sega Game Gear. The Game Gear version was only released in North America.

There are noticeable differences between the Japanese and US versions of the arcade game - the US version has a MLB license and uses US teams, while the Japanese version opts for Japanese players and teams. There are also subtle changes to the presentation to reflect the two regions. A Chicken Leg, an enemy seen in Altered Beast and Golden Axe, makes a cameo appearance in the results screen.

Clutch Hitter is considered to be an entry in the Super League series of baseball games, directly inspiring the improvements Pro Yakyuu Super League '91 made to Super League.
