Fairly similar to most overhead shooters of the time. The player moves an attack jet up a vertically scrolling screen shooting air and land targets with guns and bombs. Features various unremarkable power-ups.

While switching between air and ground attacks, take out the approaching large and small craft and large fleets.

Powering up allows you to use different powerful air attacks and wider ranged ground attacks depending on the ship's form.
