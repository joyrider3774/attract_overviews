Plus Alpha is a top-view type shooter game with bright and very childish-looking graphics - but wait, don't judge a game only because it looks childish. Some people don't like games with graphics like this, but you have to know the difference between childish-looking graphics and childish *gameplay*. Plus Alpha never makes you feel like you're playing a game that's meant for children - because it's helluva lot of fun to play, and unlike some other games with graphics similar to Plus Alpha, it's very very hard to beat.
