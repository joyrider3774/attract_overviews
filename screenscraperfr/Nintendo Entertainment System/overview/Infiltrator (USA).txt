You're Captain Johnny "Jimbo-Baby" McGibbits - The Infiltrator: Ace helicopter pilot, ballistics expert, rock star, motorcycle racer, and all-around good guy. Your assignment: Stop the Mad Leader before he fulfills his life-long goal of total world destruction. Fly through enemy airspace in your Gizmo DHX-3 Attack Chopper, better known as "The Snuffmaster."

Locate your target area, then land your Chopper and carry out the specified ground mission before time runs out. The fate of the free world is in your hands!
