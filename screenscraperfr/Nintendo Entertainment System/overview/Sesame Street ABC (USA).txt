This game is divided into two parts:

Letter-Go-Round: By catching and matching letters on a spinning ferris wheel children practice letter recognition and matching, simple spelling and word formation.

Ernie's Big Splash: Children can help Ernie find his rubber duckie for his bath by building a pathway from duckie's soap dish to Ernie's bathtub. This helps children practice planning, predicting and problem-solving.

For Ages 3-6.
