You wake up in the middle of a forest. Your head hurts. You don't remember anything: you don't know who you are, and you vaguely recall your name. A man approaches you and says his name is Darus. After realizing that you are suffering from a strange amnesia, Darus takes you to a nearby village and soon reveals to you that he is a sorcerer on a quest for revenge. You join forces, and soon become involved in a complex mystery of a kidnapped princess, the destruction of the world, and search for your own identity...

Radia Senki is set in a semi-modern, semi-medieval environment, and introduces an unusual blend between action and strategic RPG. During the pre-set (not random) battles, your party and the enemies can freely move around the battle screen. You control the main character by attacking in real time, but you can pause at any time and give a command to other party members: attack a specified enemy, be offensive in general, use a healing or other technique, pretend to be dead, etc.
