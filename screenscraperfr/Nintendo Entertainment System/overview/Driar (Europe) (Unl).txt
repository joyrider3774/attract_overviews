You move the Driar the dinosaur through the levels, completing them when you collect all the stars. You avoid the stationary obstacles and enemies that move in a fixed path aided only by your jump and sprint buttons. The one thing of note (and not apparent from the screenshots) is that the levels wrap around left-right and sometimes you'll need to utilise this - the most difficult occurrences being when you have to judge a jump from one side of the screen to the other.
