You control Sgt. Helmet ? your mission is collecting 5 bombs, setting them in the DULL computer, and then return to the base. Use keycards to open closed gates and kill every clone soldier if he stands in your way. You can destroy the barbed wire to progress (but avoid touching them!) as well. But beware! Bullets are prized and you better save them. You can refill your ammo with the magazines you will find across the map ? but you better be savvy. Use boulders to block lasers so your ass doesn't get burned and? GOOD LUCK!
