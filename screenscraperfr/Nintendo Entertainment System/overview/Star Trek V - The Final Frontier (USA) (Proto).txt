Star Trek V: The Final Frontier was a 2D platform game which was developed by Bandai for the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System). It was based on Star Trek V: The Final Frontier but was canceled before its intended release. The incomplete game was inconsistent with many plot and character elements of the finished film.

In 2006, a four-stage prototype version was leaked online as a ROM image file that can be played either through PC emulation or on an actual NES.

The first two stages and final stage were in the form of a side-to-side shooter. The third stage entailed space combat in which the player took the USS Enterprise-A through an asteroid field and then into battle against a Klingon cruiser near the "creation planet".
