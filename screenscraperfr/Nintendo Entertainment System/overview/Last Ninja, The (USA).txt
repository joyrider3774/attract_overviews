In The Last Ninja, you assume the role of Armakuni as he searches Manhattan for the elusive Kunitoki. Through six 3D stages, you'll have to use both your ninja skills as a fighter and a thinker to take on your enemies and solve the puzzles impeding your progress. You'll amass many types of weapons and objects along the way, but their ultimate use may differ from the obvious. In the end, you'll have to show Kunitoki who's boss in any century. Show him what it means to be The Last Ninja.
