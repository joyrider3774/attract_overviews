You control a hero who has a phantom twin, his alter ego. When the hero moves, the alter ego moves too in a mirrored fashion. In some levels the movements are mirrored horizontally, in other ones they are mirrored vertically. You can switch between the hero and his alter ego limited number of times in a level.
