There were plans for a sequel to Cheetahmen I, but it was not completed (6 of 10 proposed levels were made) and was never officially released. In 1996, however, 1,500 copies of the game were located in a warehouse and eventually put on sale on the secondary market. All copies of the game were reused Action 52 cartridges, some with a small gold sticker reading "Cheetamen II". This cartridge is now very rare and hard to find, though numerous ROM images exist on the Internet. Dr. Morbis is out to destroy the Cheetahmen with all new traps and dangers. It is up to the Cheetahmen to make their way to Dr. Morbis' secret (and heavily guarded) laboratory to battle Dr. Morbis and his sub-humans (including the new, powerful ape-man). Cheetahmen II is a side scrolling platform game with arcade style action. There are three different Cheetahmen to control, a different one every second level.
