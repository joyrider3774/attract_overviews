"Own a copy of Exerion 1+2, a multicart of unlimited scrolling shooting!

Blast your way through clouds of enemies in these Famicom and unreleased games. 

Exerion 1 - It was 1985 and Jaleco ported this great arcade game to the Famicom. In the style of Galaga and 1942, Exerion featured vertical scrolling while shooting many enemies. Parallax backgrounds and moving terrain added to the graphics. Exerion never made it to the NES.

Exerion 2 - This sequel also never made it to the NES. For years it remained as an unreleased prototype. The users of NintendoAGE contributed to make it available so now you can play them both on one great cart!"
