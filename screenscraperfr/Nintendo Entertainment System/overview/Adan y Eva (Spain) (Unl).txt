Adam and Eve, were free and happily playing in the garden of Eden, but a perverse and hypocritical serpent makes their life insecure and miserable. In order to protect and protect their garden from Eden, Adan and Eve try to hunt the snake out of the garden. Unfortunately the snake always mocks Adam and Eve. Who will lend a hand in this war? Nobody knows. Please give your spiritual support in action.
