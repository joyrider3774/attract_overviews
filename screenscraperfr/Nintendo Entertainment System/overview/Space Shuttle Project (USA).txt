The Launch Director has assigned a Commander to take control of several NASA Space Launches to do some necessary jobs in space. It is the commanderâ€™s job to do all the pre-launch activities like fuelling the space ship and making sure all the crew are on safely and making sure all the post-launch activities are carried out like the rocket and fuel tank separation as well as the successful landing of the shuttle. The commander is also responsible for the extravehicular activities in space such as launching a satellite and building a space station.
