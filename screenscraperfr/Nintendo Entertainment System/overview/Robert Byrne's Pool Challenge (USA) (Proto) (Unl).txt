Robert Byrne's Pool Challenge (from here on out referred to as "Cue Stick') was being developed by Odyssey Software during 1992. George C. Rucker III programmed the Cue Stick game and it would later be passed on to American Video Entertainment for publishing. Do to a twist of fate with the gravity of the pool balls in Cue Stick, the game was pushed back and passed on to American Video too late.nnnnAmerican Video Entertainment had licensed the game with famous pool shark Robert Byrnes. Byrnes requested some last minute changes before the game shipped, American Video Entertainment folded, and Cue Stick was canned. Odyssey Software survived for a few more years before they met a similar fate.nnnnThe game is filled with tons of features. There are four different modes of play including Straight Pool and Nine Ball, a trainer mode, and several table colors to choose from. There are also several different frictions (or lack of) that you can add to the table, including ice and sand. This option gives the balls a slightly different behavior, increasing the challenge.nnnnCue Stick is viewed similarly to Side Pocket. If you press select during gameplay you can see the numbers on the different balls. A chart at the bottom allows you to decide the force of the Cue Stick against the Cue Ball.nnnnAt first appearence one might comment that it is just another pool game. However, the options make the game superb.
