It's not hard to understand what this game is about, judging by its title: a simulation of Australian football, a code of football that is little known outside of Australia but is very popular in certain areas of the country. You can either train your players (one, two, or three players at a time), play a single match, or participate in an Australian tournament, choosing one team and leading it to victory.
