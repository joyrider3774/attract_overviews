in this community lived a rat, a beetle called Booky Man, two lizards and a bug. Booky Man, the beetle, liked to have everything clean and promised the rat to help her clean the streets, but the two lizards are always chasing Booky. Booky must go through the tunnels to avoid the attacks of the lizards or use the sweeping brush to chase the Lizards home and kill the bug, who dirties the streets.
