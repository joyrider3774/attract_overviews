Quadz is a Nintendo Entertainment System port of the game Squarez. You get a random 3x3 tetris-like piece, and have to place it somewhere in your game area before the timer runs out!. When you form a completely filled 3x3 square it is removed from the game area. The more you get at a time, the more points you get!. When playing against an opponent, clearing large areas will move the dividing wall closer to their side, making your inevitable victory that much closer.
