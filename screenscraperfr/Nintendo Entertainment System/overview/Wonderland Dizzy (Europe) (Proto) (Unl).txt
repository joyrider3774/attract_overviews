Wonderland Dizzy For NES HERE AT LAST - its only taken Codemasters (aherm) 20 years to get this bad boy developed and released, well technically NOT Codemasterr...

While the original game series, which included the first game, its sequels Treasure Island Dizzy and Fantasy World Dizzy, was developed by twins Andrew and Philip Oliver, future sequels came under the wings of Big Red Software. However, the lads didn't just stop with those three Dizzy games, they were also working on a fourth and final game by the name of Wonderland Dizzy which unfortunately was never released. This game was supposed to be released for NES in 1993.
