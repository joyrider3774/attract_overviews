Players control a boy with a helmet who kicks balls at enemies in an attempt to save his girlfriend from a unknown force inside an amusement park. The more damage he takes the more damage he does to enemies.


The game was renamed The Trolls in Crazyland for release on the NES by American Softworks. It was previously scheduled to be released as Crazyland, but was then changed to feature the popular Troll dolls. That version was only released in Italy(PAL-A), and Eastern Europe(PAL-B).
