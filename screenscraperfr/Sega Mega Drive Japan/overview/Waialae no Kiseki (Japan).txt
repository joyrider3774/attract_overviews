New 3D Golf Simulation: Waialae no Kiseki ("Waialae's Miracle") was originally released on the Super Nintendo in the US as True Golf Classics: Waialae Country Club. It was ported to the Sega Mega Drive in Japan in early 1994 the month after Devil's Course 3D Golf, which is also by T&E Soft.nnnnThe mechanics are simple to understand with options to select your club, stance, direction, and a circular meter for selecting the power of your shot. Like with many golf games, this will require good timing. Once the power level is selected, a ball with a dot tracing along its surface is shown and a button push selects where the ball will be hit. There are some customizations for your character including the ability to select a caddie and name your player. Your name, as well as records and progress, can be saved via battery backup.
