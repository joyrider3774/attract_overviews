GP World was produced by Sega in 1984. In this laserdisc racing game, you have the choice between one of the three circuits proposed to compete with computer-controlled racing cars.
It is a rather average game in the realization where it is difficult to feel the feeling of speed despite the projection of the real circuits filmed as scenery.
But it is moving away from the traditional laserdisc spirit, interactive cartoons and shoot'em up, which changes a bit.
