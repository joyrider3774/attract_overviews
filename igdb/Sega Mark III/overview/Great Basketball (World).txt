This is basketball at the professional level. Full of international competition from the first jump ball to the last jump shot. Whether it's four on three or three on two - the action is fast and furious. And there are no favorites in this demanding play. You'll be called for double dribbling, cheered for every slam-dunk and carried off the court for making the winning free throw. But so will your opponent. So go for it. Your tough offense can put a "fast break" in the opposing team's stride while your defense remains solid as a rock. But think fast - because two can play at this game - and only one can win!
