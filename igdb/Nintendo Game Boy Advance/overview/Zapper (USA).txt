Zapper is an action-packed and addictive game that starts with the 'avoid-em-up' game play mechanics of Blitz Games' own Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge, and then takes the action to a whole new level. In this action-adventure game, Zapper (a cricket) hops his way through six interactive worlds in a quest to find his brother, held captive by the evil magpie queen. Dangerous traps and even more dangerous enemies await Zapper. It will take fast-footed skill and timing to conquer all the worlds and survive the final showdown with the magpie queen.
