Based on the best-selling book that has sold over 6.7 million copies worldwide, the game takes players on a nighttime adventure. When the Bears are caught in a thunderous storm and lose their way, they take shelter in a looming, crooked old oak tree in the heart of a dark wood. This giant oak turns out to be The Spooky Old Tree, and without a moment's rest, the Bears must work together to confront the many frightful beasts dwelling within.
