The game that spawned more than 15 others, Bomberman, returns to the Game Boy Advance with its unique combination of action and puzzle-solving. As the title character, you must blow up bricks and enemies on the battlefield in an effort to find the door to the next level. In each stage, you'll find power-ups that extend your blast radius. However, if you're caught in your own bomb blast, you must start the level over.
