Uncle Scrooge has invited you and a whole cast of Disney characters to visit his new Party Park, which he designed himself with all of his favorite youngsters in mind. Disney's Party drops you into the mix with Mickey Mouse and friends to embark on challenging adventures that include collecting magical objects, solving puzzles, and maneuvering through obstacle courses. Each player must complete his or her game board by buying or winning special items, such as stars, lollipops, and teacups. In four different gameplay modes, you can compete with friends in minigames, solve puzzles, and explore a variety of environments.
