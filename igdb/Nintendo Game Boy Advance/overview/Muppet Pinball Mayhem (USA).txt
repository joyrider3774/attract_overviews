Everyone's favorite puppets are the stars of this blistering, addicting pinball extravaganza. Jim Henson's beloved creations grace every nook and cranny of this deliriously exciting handheld game, which was created specifically to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of THE MUPPETS. Play as Kermit, Miss Piggy, Animal, or a handful of other franchise characters each of which will give the table slightly different physics. There are four tables for you to master, which makes for an extremely high replay value. There are also more adjustable settings than you can shake a stick at, meaning the game grows to match your skill level, as you become a more advanced player. In the unlikely event that you should conquer all four levels, try your hand at any of the 20 mini-games that are included to round out the package. Fabulous graphics and classic MUPPET humor are ever present in MUPPET PINBALL MAYHEM for the Game Boy Advance.
