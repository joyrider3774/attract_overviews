Take a stroll down memory lane with the classic side-scrolling game Castlevania. The game, which is part of the Classic NES Series on the Game Boy Advance, sets you off on a mission to undo the curse of the evil Count. Before you challenge the Count, you must first battle his army of ghosts, mummies, bats, and zombies. Use your magic whip and other weapons if you want to make it out of the castle alive.
