Professor Pac learns that the witch, Mesmerelda, has seized control of the Enchanted Castle using black magic and from there is planning on stealing all four Gems of Virtue (Generosity; Truth; Wisdom; Courage) to control the "four wonders" (areas of Pac-Land). He creates a device called a Pactrometer which allows Ms. Pac-Man to go to these areas to recover the gems before Mesmerelda can get them first.
