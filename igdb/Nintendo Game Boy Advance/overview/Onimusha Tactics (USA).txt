Get ready for a new kind of Onimusha, where every move is a struggle for power. In Onimusha Tactics, you'll join Onimaru, a young Ogre clan warrior on a quest to defeat Nobunaga and his Genma armies. You must call upon your demon powers and sword skills to fight against evil legions. Manage your resources and equipment, assemble your allies, recruit the strongest warriors, and then move in for the attack. Don't forget to absorb the souls of your fallen enemies--their Ogre stones let you create new items.
