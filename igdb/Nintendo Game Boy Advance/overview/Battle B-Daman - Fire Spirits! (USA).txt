In this action game based on the toy franchise, you play as a young boy called Yamato who loves his B-Daman machines more than anything. You'll face off in B-Daman battles with Yamato's rivals, making use of special attacks to emerge victorious. Throughout the course of the game, you'll customize your machines and raise Yamato. Yamato will also meet characters both familiar and unknown on his journeys, including the warm-hearted Alan and the sinister-looking Goblin. Only a few have what it takes to become a B-Daplayer; will Yamato become the B-Dachampion?
