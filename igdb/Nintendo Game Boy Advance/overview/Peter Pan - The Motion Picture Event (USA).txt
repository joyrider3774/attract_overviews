Explore, soar and save the day in an action-packed epic adventure, based on Universal Studios' motion picture event, Peter Pan. Play as Peter Pan and join Wendy, John, Michael and Tinker Bell on a fantastic journey from London to Neverland. Relive fierce pirate battles, hair-raising danger, narrow escapes and ultimately face off against the notorious Captain Hook. Played from a three-quarter view perspective, Peter Pan can fly, jump, dive, roll, walk, and use his sword to fight enemies. In addition to combat, puzzle solving, and platform jumping, players have to collect special objects for extra lives and bonus points. Developed by Saffire, Peter Pan also features digitized scenes from the movie.
