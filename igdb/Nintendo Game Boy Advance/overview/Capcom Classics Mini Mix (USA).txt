An action-packed compilation of three of Capcom's most popular titles, originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The trio of old school action titles includes "Bionic Commando," "Strider" and "Mighty Final Fight," all faithfully recreated and available to play in either the original aspect ratio or stretched to fill the handheld's widescreen display.
