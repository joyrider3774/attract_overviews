Van Helsing is a third-person shooter for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, Game Boy Advance and Mobile phone, which is based on the 2004 action/horror film of the same name by Stephen Sommers. Starting off with the killing of Mr. Hyde in Paris, one must use the character of Van Helsing to hunt down Dracula in Transylvania. The character of Carl is completely missing from the video game but to reasonable accuracy, the characters of Anna Valerious, Velkan Valerious, Igor, Dracula and his three brides are portrayed as in the movie.
