Produced in part by Marvel's dedicated game production division, this game is based on the Marvel comic and 2006 motion picture starring Nick Cage. The tormented superhero/anti-hero Johnny Blaze, once a heroic daredevil cycle rider before making a deal with the devil for his soul in exchange for the life of his father, rides in this action-packed videogame adventure.
