Join Barbie on horseback and ride through eight different locations in a race to the finish line. It's the National Horse charity event, and you're invited to ride and compete in a variety of events. You'll race through lush countryside, gallop around rock formations, canter down country roads, and more. Use skill and speed to dodge obstacles such as rocks, hay bales, and forest animals. Special power-ups help you to run even faster to earn more points.
