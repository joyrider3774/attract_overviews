Player move Postman Pat through the village of Greendale delivering mail. On his route, Pat meets most known locales and characters from the TV series and faces plenty of obstacles and adventures making delivery more difficult and the gameplay more interesting and varied. Since the game is designed to be played by kids, all obstacles are of a non-aggressive nature, so rather than the van hitting objects on the road there can be mud puddles that slow down the van.
