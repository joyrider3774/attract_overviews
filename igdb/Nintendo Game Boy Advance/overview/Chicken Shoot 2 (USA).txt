Climb behind the trigger and again help our distressed farmer friend obliterate hordes of no good cluckers! Stalk through forests and villages, through deserts and mountains, winging winged adversaries and piling up points! The cartoon feel is all Saturday morning fun, but as the missions progress in difficulty, you'll soon find yourself challenged to the limit of your Kentucky Fried skills!
