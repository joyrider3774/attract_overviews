With its unique comic-book inspired art style, Crushed Baseball 2004 will offer fast-paced arcade gameplay that will appeal to both sports and non-sports gaming fans. With its over-the-top style, players will be able to power-up characters and give them superhuman abilities and special powers called "Mojo" abilities. For example, a pitcher might throw a pitch that acts as a buzz-saw and slices through the hitter's bat; a batter may hit a ground ball that lodges itself in the field so it can't be picked up, and a fielder might use their suction glove ability to suction the ball into their glove to record an out.
