In your return to Battle City, you begin another mission to retrieve stolen millennium cards that can destroy the world. Yu-Gi-Oh! Reshef of Destruction features an all-new storyline that sets you off on a quest to stop Reshef from drowning the world in darkness. Since the game's battles are fought with cards, you must build a strong deck from 800 different cards (including all three Egyptian god cards) to even stand a chance against your enemies.
