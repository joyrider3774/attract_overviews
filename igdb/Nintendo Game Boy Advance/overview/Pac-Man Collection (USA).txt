One of the first video games ever created, PAC-MAN still happens to be one of the best, as well. This comprehensive collection includes three unique Pac-Man titles in one complete package. Inside you'll find the original Pac-Man which has you traversing mazes, avoiding deadly ghosts, and chomping down nutritious dots; Pac-Mania is a 3D take on the first version, in which you can actually jump over the ghosts; and Pac-Attack is a Tetris-like experience that'll have you lining up blocks in a fast-paced environment.
