Electronic Arts' Need For Speed series takes a note from the Fast and Furious handbook with its latest release entitled Need For Speed Underground. Purchase, race, and customize 20 different licensed cars from major manufacturers such as Honda, Mitsubishi, Toyota, Volkswagen, Nissan, and more. Race other customized cars through a detailed nighttime cityscape, dodging city traffic and navigating shortcuts all the while. Customize vehicle performance as well as your car's physical appearance, changing rims, stickers, paint job, spoilers and more. Multiple racing modes range from drift competitions, street racing, and drag racing.
