The game puts the player inside the action of the hit TV show, and features 12 spine-tingling stunts that will test gamers' steadiness, stomachs and nerve. Players can choose to play Fear Factor: Unleashed single player mode, where they will face five other competitors in an intense three-challenge contest to crown a winner. They can also play other custom single player modes or set up profiles for six friends and challenge each other in several party-style multiplayer modes.
