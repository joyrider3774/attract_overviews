If Snood is new to you, then you probably don't download much shareware from the Internet. The color-matching puzzle game has been a mainstay on PCs for several years. It may remind you a little of Bust-a-Move, but its simplified game play and colorful characters add a new dimension to the fun. Fire colorful, little Snoods into each other so they cling together and then fall from the lineup.
