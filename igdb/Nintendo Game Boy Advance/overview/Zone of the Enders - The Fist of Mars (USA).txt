Based on the popular PlayStation2 title, Zone of the Enders: The Fist of Mars is a 2-D, turn-based strategy game in which players take control of an army of trucks, tanks, fighters, and giant anime-styled robots, called LEVs, to fight for liberation as part of the Mars underground resistance. Players must carefully select their actions, move around large battlefields, and think tactically when engaging enemy units. Battle experience will make you more powerful, and you will be able to optimize and upgrade your units.
