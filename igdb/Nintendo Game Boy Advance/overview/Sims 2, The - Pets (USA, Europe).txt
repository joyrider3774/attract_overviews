Pets is the fourth expansion pack in The Sims 2 series of games published by Electronic Arts.
Create the perfect pet for your Sims to train, play with, and love. Choose from dozens of the most popular dog and cat breeds like Dalmatians and Persians. Or create a unique cat or dog by customizing their features and body type. Then pick a personality—you decide if your Sims’ Siamese is cowardly, gifted, or lazy. Your Sims can teach their pets tricks, take them for a romp in the park to meet other furry friends, and much more as they share a lifetime together. But remember, your Sims’ pets have minds of their own—cats claw sofas, dogs roll in flowerbeds, and worse. Expect the unexpected!
