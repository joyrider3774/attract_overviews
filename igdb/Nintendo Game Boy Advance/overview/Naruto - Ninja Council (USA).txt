Just like a true ninja, in Naruto: Ninja Council (aka Ninja Council 3 in the USA), players will have to protect, defend or defeat as they train hard to perfect their skills in order to progress through the ranks in over 40 missions. Players can activate special attacks using the Nintendo DS stylus on the touch screen or by blowing into the microphone, and can choose from 20 of their favourite characters. The game also features four game modes, dual screen and touch pen support, a new interchangeable attack system, and wireless play with up to four players.
