WARNING: Stitch is extremely dangerous. The result of an illegal genetic experiment by a mad scientist, Stitch appears to be harmless - small, furry, with six legs - but his very existence is an abomination to all that's decent in the galaxy. Last seen on the island of Hawaii in the company of a little named Lilo. Fugitive may be disguised as a family pet.
