Sonic is back, and this time, he needs the help of all of his friends to defeat the evil Dr. Eggman. In Sonic Advance 3, Sonic and Tails must reunite with their friends Cream, Knuckles, and Amy. Team up with any of the five characters to gain special attack moves: Sonic increases your speed, Tails increases your jump power, Knuckles increases your attack power, Amy offers the Piko Piko hammer attack, and Cream lets you perform a homing attack. With a Game Boy Advance link, you and three of your friends can battle it out in multiplayer modes.
