The Ace Combat series makes its debut on the Game Boy Advance with challenging missions, unlockable planes, and free-roaming environments. As the newest pilot in an elite fighter squadron, you must help destroy the Air Strike Force--the military arm of an evil multinational corporation. If you destroy enough enemy planes during your missions, you'll unlock new planes. Fly in air-to-air and air-to-ground missions over arctic, forest, and desert environments. Each environment features destructible buildings and objects.
