Firefly Swamp is dying and the frogs from the Elder Council have asked Frogger to save it! To do so, Frogger must undertake a grueling quest to collect the sacred elements needed to keep the swamp alive. These elements have been stolen by the evil Mr. D and have been spread throughout four perilous worlds. Frogger must travel to each world retrieve the stolen elements and defeat Mr. D's evil henchmen. Then and only then will he be able to enter the Temple of the Frog to face the treacherous Mr. D.
