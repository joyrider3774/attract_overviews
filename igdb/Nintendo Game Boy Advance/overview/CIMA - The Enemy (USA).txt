For decades, the human race and the CIMA race have been in constant conflict with one another. As Ark J, your mission is to guard the gate between the two worlds, protect your appointed town, and ultimately, find peace. You'll progress through a nonlinear storyline while solving puzzles, exploring worlds, and battling enemies. The game includes a combat system that features both action and strategy elements. Another feature lets you activate non-playable characters to help you accomplish your goals.
