Tales of Phantasia (テイルズ オブ ファンタジア Teiruzu obu Fantajia?) is the first installment of the Tales series, and was released by Namco in 1995 for the Super Famicom. Released at the end of 1995, Tales of Phantasia is considered one of the crowning achievements for its time. It has graphics that push the console to its limits, an original never-before-seen battle system, and the addition of actual voices and voice actors. It is also the first and only Super Famicom game to feature an entirely original, vocalized theme song featured directly in the game. 
 
In the game, the protagonist is Cress Albane, along with his comrades: Chester Burklight, Mint Adenade, Claus F. Lester, Arche Klein, and in later remakes, Suzu Fujibayashi. The heroes fight against Dhaos, an evil overlord, while travelling through time to save their world.
