Pac-Man takes on the role of the pinball, and his foes Blinky, Inky, Pinky and Clyde are going to do their best to stop him from rescuing the kidnapped residents of Pac-World. Pac-Man Pinball offers multi-ball play with the aid of Ms. Pac-Man, and challenges players to mini-games to keep the action fresh. True to Pac-Man tradition, players can also collect dots and power pellets for points and upgrades.
