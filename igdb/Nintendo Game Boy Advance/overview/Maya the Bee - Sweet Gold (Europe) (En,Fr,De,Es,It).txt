Game Boy Advance game based on the German children's book (which in turn spawned a Japanese anime series), Maya the Bee (Die Biene Maja). The game offers 60 different levels in seven graphically different environments, as well as oodles of bonus levels. An overworld map, filled with puzzles and challenges, connects all the levels. Players choose from either Maja (Maya) or Willi. The story involves teacher Kassandra (Cassandra), who is kidnapped by nasty hornets. The evil insects want to trade Kassandra for five pots of honey. Maja and Willi set out to free Kassandra and return order to the hive.
