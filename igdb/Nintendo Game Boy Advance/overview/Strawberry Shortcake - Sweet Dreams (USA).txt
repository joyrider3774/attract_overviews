Based on Strawberry Shortcake's feature film, Sweet Dreams lets fans play as Strawberry Shortcake and her friends Raspberry Torte, Angel Cake, Ginger Snap and even Sleepbug. Flying, driving and adventure scenarios challenge the characters to work together to save Strawberryland and beat the Purple Pieman! As the game progresses, My Sweets mode also details each character's accomplishments and unlocks special pictures. The game incorporates actual images from the CGI-animated film.
