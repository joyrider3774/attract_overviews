Ethan Hunt and the Impossible Mission Force (IMF) are brought into an investigation of a shady international corporation, known as SURMA, that is in possession of a highly advanced computer virus known as Ice Worm. It has the power to break through any type of security system and could lead to the theft of any data ranging from nuclear weapons specs to intelligence of any government.

The team must find this worm to protect global internet security.
