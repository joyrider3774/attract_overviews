Garﬁeld has lost his favorite Pooky Bear...Young players must help Garﬁeld in his search for Pooky. The game takes Garﬁeld through his best known haunts interacting with his favorite characters e.g. Jon, Odie and Arlene to name but a few. No cat's tale would be complete without the usual encounters such as: dogs, mice, spiders & scraps of food. 
 
True to his character Garﬁeld can not resist eating as much as possible throughout the game but food equals' energy & energy enables this fat cat to perform extraordinary moves throughout his adventures in the game. At the same time all sorts of obstacles will have to be avoided, such as web spinning spiders, happy Odie rushing towards Garﬁeld, bad food, annoying kids, angry pit-bulls and more.
