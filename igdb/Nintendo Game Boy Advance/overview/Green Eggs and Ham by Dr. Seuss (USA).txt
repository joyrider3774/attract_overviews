Do you like Green Eggs and Ham? That is the question asked by Sam I am, as he leads you through the many zany Seussian worlds in search of this somewhat odd delicacy. "Would you? Could you? In a car? On a boat? On a train? In a tree?" Use the stylized 3-dimensional game board to lead you from adventure to adventure, collecting green eggs and ham as you go. "I do so like green eggs and ham. Thank you! Thank you. Sam I am."
