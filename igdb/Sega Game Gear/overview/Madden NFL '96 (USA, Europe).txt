Madden NFL 96 is one of the earlier games in the long lasting franchise. It is the first to include a create-a-player feature that had the player preform mini games similar to real NFL drills. With 28 NFL teams and many more secret historic teams, Real NFL players, and the iconic NFL on Fox music theme, Madden 96 offered an authentic experience for fans of the sport.
