Tails must stop the Battle Fortress bird army from taking control of Tails Island to rule over the animals. 
 
On land, in the air, and at sea, Tails battles some pretty tough birds! 
Depending on the Japanese and international version of the game, Tails Adventure is either a prequel or continuation of the Sonic the Hedgehog games for the Sega Genesis. The game mixes traditional platforming and role-playing elements, as Tails is using different items and abilities, as well piloting his creations Remote Robot and Sea Fox, to travel across Cocoa Island to liberate it from the Battle Kukku Empire. Like many Sonic games for the Game Gear, Tails Adventure has been ported onto numerous compilation titles and other games as an unlockable game. It later received a re-release on the Nintendo 3DS in 2013.
