Your girlfriend... She's gone! Kidnapped by the notorious King Drancon. 
But this is no ordinary rescue mission. Because King Drancon is no ordinary adversary. 
Enter the deepest of deep dark forests. And trek across the burning deserts of 10 different lands. Discover supplies that give you speed and strength. Then fend for yourself against nature's nastiest enemies - cobras, piranhas, bats, spiders and finally, King Drancon's lightning-speed fireballs.
