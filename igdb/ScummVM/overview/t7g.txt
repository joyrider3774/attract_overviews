The 7th Guest is a horror adventure described as “the first Interactive Drama”, with plentiful pre-rendered 3D graphics, live action video clips, and an original, orchestrated musical score. Even though it was one of the first games on a CD, it broke the record of 2 million copies sold in 1993, and was considered an epoch-making achievement of the gaming industry. To this day the FMV sequences and 3D graphics look amazing, the atmosphere (orchestrated music!) is dense, the puzzles remain difficult and the experience as a whole is completely horrifying.
