A deep space adventure by Sean Clark in collaboration with filmmaker Steven Spielberg. 
 
You've saved the Earth from Total Destruction. Now, Can you save yourself? 
 
An asteroid the size of a small moon is on a crash course toward Earth, and only NASA veteran Boston Low has the expertise to stop it. Along for the ride are award-winning journalist Maggie Robbins and internationally renowned geologist Ludger Brink. 
 
Once the wayward asteroid is nuked into a safe orbit, the trio conducts a routine examination of the rocky surface. 
 
What they uncover is anything but routine. 
 
Low, Brink and Robbins unwittingly trigger a mechanism that transforms the asteroid into a crystal-like spacecraft. The team is hurled across the galaxy to a planet so desolate, Brink is moved to name it Cocytus, after the 9th circle of Hell in Dante's Inferno.

But no Cocytans. 
 
Who were the original inhabitants of this once rich empire-turned-wasteland? What are those apparitions that mysteriously appear from time to time? Why have Low, Robbins and Brink been brought to this place? And how can Low keep his team from unraveling in the face of such uncertainly? To return to Earth, the must dig for answer, both on the planet's surface and deep within themselves.
