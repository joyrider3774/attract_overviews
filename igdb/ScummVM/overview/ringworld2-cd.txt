After saving the puppeteer race from extermination and uncovering some powerful ancient technology in the first game, Quinn, Seeker of Vengeance and Miranda Rees find themselves searched as fugitives by all three major species, so they go to Ringworld to hide. Once in Ringworld they'll try to uncover some evidence to clear their names, but they stumble across another universe-threatening plot. This time U.N. general Carson Teal is out to rule the universe by uncovering Ringworld's secrets, and you must stop him. 
 
Return to Ringworld is the sequel to the Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch. Like its predecessor, it is based on Larry Niven's Known Space series of novels. Once again this game is a puzzle-solving point-and-click adventure. This game is much larger than its predecessor, with hundreds of screens, mazes, etc. The player can control three characters throughout the game, a la Day of the Tentacle.
