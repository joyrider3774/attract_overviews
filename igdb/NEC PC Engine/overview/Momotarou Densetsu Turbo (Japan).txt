A turn-based RPG featuring the famous Peach Boy of Japanese folklore, and the enhanced remake of the first Momotarou Densetsu game. It was released shortly before the game's official sequel, also for PC Engine. 
 
Momotarou Densetsu Turbo ("Peach Boy Legend Turbo") is the second game in the Momotarou Densetsu franchise, though is effectively a revamp of the first game released for the Famicom. The game displays Momotarou's origins as a baby born of a giant peach that a kindly couple found floating down a river, and covers how he met his animal companions and fought the Oni on their island. 
 
The game sets up the sequel, Momotarou Densetsu II, which was released exclusively for the PC Engine a few months later.
