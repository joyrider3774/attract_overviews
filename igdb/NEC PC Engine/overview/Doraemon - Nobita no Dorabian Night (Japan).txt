Taking a different route to its maze-based predecessor, this Doraemon game is a side scrolling platformer with a simple, colourful look. You have to rescue your friends who have dived into various books and are pursued by the inhabitants within. You start off having to avoid the wandering beasties, but eventually get hold of such items as a gun that freezes anything in your path for a moment. Along the way you get to ride on dinosaurs, crawl under moving stone blocks, creep along precarious ledges and slide down water chutes.
