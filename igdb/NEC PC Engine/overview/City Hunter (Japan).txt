A side-scrolling action game based on the manga and anime of the same name, concerning the private eye Ryo Saeba. 
 
City Hunter is a side-scrolling action game exclusive to the PC Engine. The player controls Ryo Saeba, the eponymous "City Hunter" private eye who often takes assignments from attractive female clients. Despite his lechery, he's a highly competent gunman and very sharp when reading people. 
 
The game is built similarly to Impossible Mission: Ryo explores buildings, checking doors for mission-critical NPCs and items while shooting the enemy thugs that attack him while investigating. It contains four stages, or "chapters", and appearances from various characters from the franchise like Ryo's partner Kaori Makimura, his rival Umibozu and his police contact Seiko Nogami.
