Ganbare! Golf Boys ("Do Your Best! Golf Boys") is a PC Engine exclusive golf game that allows for up to four players to compete is a round of golf via the console's multi-tap peripheral. It did not receive a US localization. 
 
The game has a permanent top-down view of each hole, zooming in whenever the player is on the green, and has the "hit the sweet spot" power gauge system standard to most golf simulators. It features a total of two courses, with eighteen holes apiece. 
 
Ganbare! Golf Boys is notable for being the first project that prominent game musician Atsuhiro Motoyama ever worked on.
