Moto Roader is a futuristic racing game that allows up to five players to compete against each other. Players use the cash earned when they win a race to power up their machine. Not only can they change the "tire" and "body" of their vehicles, but they also can add "special" parts. Jump over tall obstacles with a "hopper" and blast past rivals at incredible speeds with "nitro." What multiplayer game would be complete without attack items? Use a forward-launching "grenade" or a backward-dropping "bomber" to blow up and knock away rivals. Outmaneuver rivals in all eight heats to become the champion.
