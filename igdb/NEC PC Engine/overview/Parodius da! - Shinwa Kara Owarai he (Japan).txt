Konami's imaginative parody on the Gradius series. It plays just like Gradius, with the same power-up system, but features a far more bizarre and imaginative series of levels and characters. 
This game was released in Japan for the PC Engine and is a port of the Arcade original with a couple of differences: it doesn't have the arcade Stages 5 and 8, but features a stage titled SPECIAL and a new introduction that features several strange-looking Japanese characters. This is in contrast to the arcade intro, which chronicles the Gradius legacy up until the time of release.
