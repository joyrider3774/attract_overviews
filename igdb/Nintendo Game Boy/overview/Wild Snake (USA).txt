A deadly nest of snakes. And only you can keep them from getting out! Maneuver each new snake so it touches another of the same kind, making the venomous viper disappear. Sound easy? As long as you con keep matching up snakes, you're in control. But when those poisonous reptiles pile close to the top, you better run for your life! 
 
Both Sega Mega Drive and Sega Game Gear versions of WildSnake were advertised for release, but both were cancelled for unknown reasons. Pototypes of both have since surfaced.
