Booby Kids (ブービーキッズ?) is an action video game for the Nintendo Family Computer. This video game is the home conversion of Nichibutsu's arcade game, Kid no Hore Hore Daisakusen (キッドのホレホレ大作戦?), that was originally supposed to be named Booby Kids. 
 
In 1993, Nichibutsu released for the Game Boy a similar game entitled Booby Boys.[2][3]
