There are several options in the game including: difficulty level, whether to race in MPH or KM/H, steering ability, whether or not to have a track map, chevrons, and position flashing. The object is to race laps around a muddy race track while trying to get first place. There are twenty tracks to race in; each with a timer that forces the player to race fast. There is an option to either do a single race or a multi-race tournament against a computer opponent or through a human playing while using the Game Boy link cable and another copy of the video game. Items in the background like electric lines and rocks help provide a road-like feeling to the races. 
 
In a single-player race, the player will race to the finish line against a field of approximately nineteen other drivers.
