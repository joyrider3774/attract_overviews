King James Bible For Use on Game Boy was published by Wisdom Tree in 1994. Like Wisdom Tree's other console and handheld releases, the title was never officially licensed, and thus neither supported by Nintendo nor sold through traditional shopping channels. As the title suggests, the bulk of the program is a digital copy of the King James edition of the Holy Bible, though it also includes some Bible-themed games.
