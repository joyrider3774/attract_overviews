The first game of the series, which only features sentient robots from the Universal Century Gundam series, Mazinger series and Getter Robo series. It is one of the only independent games in the series to feature a multiplayer mode; it is not done again until the release of Super Robot Wars XO. Unlike future games, the goal is to capture the enemy army's "tower," and Spirit Commands can only be used by the unit that is designated the team's "hero." The final boss of the game was the main villain from Great Mazinger vs. Getter Robo, Gilgilgan.
