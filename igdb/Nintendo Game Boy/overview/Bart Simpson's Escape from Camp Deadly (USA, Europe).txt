How bad could it be? Well, with Ironfist Burns as head counselor and Nelson and his band of bullies as bunkmates, it's not exactly paradise. Bart and Lisa are determined to get out - but first they've got to survive outrageous food fights, killer bees and a life-threatening game of capture the flag. Help Bart and Lisa escape, at least in time for school!
