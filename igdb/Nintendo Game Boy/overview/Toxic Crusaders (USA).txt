It's Clean Up Time! 
 
Only a complete and helpless nerd like Melvin Junko could be such a klutz that he would run into a vat of Grossolium 90, a terribly toxic waste by-product of the Island City Chemical Plant. Now the wimpy nerd Melvin has mutated into Toxie, a hideously deformed creature of super-human size and strength. But all is not lost, Toxie, with his newfound power, has joined forces with Major Disaster, Nozone, Headbanger, and Junkyard to form the Toxic Crusaders. No, not the ultimate heavy metal band, you moron! This motley crew is sworn to defend Tromaville and the rest of the U.S. from the polluting ways of Dr. Killemoff and his Radiation Rangers! 
 
It won't be any easy mop up operation, but with your help the Toxic Crusaders are sure to make a clean sweep of the six levels of sludge, slime, goop and grime, while washing Killemoff and his filthy friends off the face of the earth forever!
