Donkey Kong Land is a Jump & Run classic, developed by Rareware and released by Nintendo for the Game Boy in June 1995. 
 
Cranky Kong, jealous of all the success Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong have had from Donkey Kong Country on the SNES, challenges the Kongs to beat another adventure on an 8-bit system (Game Boy). As King K. Rool agrees with Cranky and steals the bananas again, Donkey & Diddy Kong set out to go throuth another adventure!
