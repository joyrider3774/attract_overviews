Taiyou no Yusha Fighbird is technically a vertically scrolling shoot'em'up game by design, though the in-game representation differs a bit from normal as you take control of a mech that can fire off energy blades. It is based off a TV show, and is one of two Fighbird games ever released, the other being another shmup game for the Famicom.
