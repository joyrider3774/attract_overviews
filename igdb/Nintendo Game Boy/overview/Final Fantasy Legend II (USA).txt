The Final Fantasy Legend series continues! In this classic RPG adventure, you are on a quest to reunite with your father. In order to find your father, you must travel far and wide to find the scattered fragments of a mystical force, known as Magi. Your quest takes you to several mysterious lands filled with caves, temples, enemy bases, ancient Japanese castles, and much more. Many of the worlds are filled with quirky inhabitants, such as the world of giants. Another world praises beauty but banishes ugliness. 
 
You can choose four heroes to accompany you in your journey. Choose from humans, robots, and even monsters. As the game progresses, you will encounter additional characters that may join your party.
