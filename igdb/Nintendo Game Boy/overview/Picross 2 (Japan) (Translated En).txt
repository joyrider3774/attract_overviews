Picross 2 is a Japan-only game for the Game Boy and the sequel to Mario's Picross and Mario's Super Picross. It keeps most of the same elements of its predecessor, as it deals with a grid and solving puzzles to form images. But unlike the first Mario's Picross, this game contains a world map. Also, the pictures are larger, consisting of four 15x15 picross boards. Both Mario and Wario return and each have different sets of puzzles to solve in the game, giving the player a variety in gameplay.
