In Torpedo Range, terrorists have basically somehow taken over most of 
the world. As a one-ship operation, you have to free six countries from the 
terrorists' grasp to win the game: to do this, you must visit a port at each of 
the six countries and destroy all the guns on the port in a shooting mini-game 
to 'liberate' the country.
