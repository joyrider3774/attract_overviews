Power Racer is a racing game which takes obvious game elements from Pac-Man. It is addictive in its own way, since you drive a small car around a track collecting pellets and avoiding contact with the opponent's car. There are items you can collect along the way, but there are also hazards and obstacles designed to mess with your progress. There are only two game modes, one on a regular course with no items (sort of like a survival mode), and a special mode where there are items and obstacles to face. You can also play in the special mode against a second human player. It can be fun, albeit tough to put down, so give it a try!
