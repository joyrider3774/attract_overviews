Batman: Return of the Joker was developed and published by Sunsoft as the second in their Batman series on the Nintendo Entertainment System. It departed from the original game by focusing on the comic-book version of Batman instead of the movie-inspired conception. The story itself was self-contained, and did not depict a pre-existing storyline. The game is a side-scrolling platformer with beat 'em up features.
