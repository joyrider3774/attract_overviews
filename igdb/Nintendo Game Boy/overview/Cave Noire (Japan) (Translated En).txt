You have come to the northern village Karuzu. As this village is surrounded by four dungeons many apprentice adventurers like yourself come here to improve their skill (level), there’s talk of the underground labyrinth (dungeon) being challenged day and night. 
 
The leader of the adventurers guild said “You should train in the dungeon if you want to become a full-fledged adventurer. You appear to have some basic equipment, although the quest (objective) will be impossible to achieve with those alone. You should go get some items from the master of the forest. If you enter the dungeon, nobody will come to help. You need to be careful.” 
 
Experience things as a true adventurer and do your best. Good luck.
