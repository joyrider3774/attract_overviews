Gargoyle's Quest II was ported to the Game Boy in 1993 in Japan only, under the name Makai-Mura Gaiden: The Demon Darkness (魔界村外伝 The Demon Darkness). This port was an enhanced version of the original title containing two new levels. It was scheduled to be released in North America in July 1993 but was later canceled.
