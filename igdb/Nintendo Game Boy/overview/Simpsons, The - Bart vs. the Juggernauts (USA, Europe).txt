Bart Simpson here, on my way to the Springfield Arena to do battle with the Juggernauts, my all-time TV heroes. 
 
It isn't going to be easy. There's nobody tougher than the Juggernauts (except maybe yours truly), but I'll be fighting 'em out on my own turf: Krustyland Amusement Park, Moe's Tavern, and the Nuclear Power Plant, just to name a few. 
 
No one knows this, but I've got a whole new set of cool manoeuvres AND a new technological edge - I can CHEAT! 
 
I'm psyched. I'm ready to rock and roll. On to victory, Man! 
 
Your pal, Bart Simpson.
