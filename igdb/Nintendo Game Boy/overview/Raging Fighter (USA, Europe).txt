Choose from seven different brawlers Vandal, Aska, Ruoh, Shades, Miyabi, Tao, and Bulk as you take it to the competition and show em who's boss. There are four different tournament styles to play in, making for intensely high replay value and variety. Each of the seven fighters brandishes a few special moves that are all their own, making for original fights every time out. Of course, there are the requisite punches and kicks, but mastering your own fighter's combos will lead you to easier victory.
