Each team has eight players (one goalkeeper, two attackers/defenders, and three midfielders). When the player moves a row, all of them are moved at once unlike on an actual table soccer set. Rows cannot be moved in an upward or a downward position; only from left to right. Stopping the ball and performing powerful shots is only one aspect of the game. Players can also incapacitate one of the opposing players on a well-timed shot. A tied game results in a penalty shootout. 
 
Three different surfaces are available. Players can practice without a computer opponent and a spectator mode allows newcomers to see two computer-controller opponents face off.
