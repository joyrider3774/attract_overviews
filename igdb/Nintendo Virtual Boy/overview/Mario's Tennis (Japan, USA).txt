Mario's Tennis is a tennis game that was released as a launch title for the Virtual Boy. It is the first tennis-related Mario game, and would later be followed by the Mario Tennis series. You get to choose from seven different characters, all with different ability levels, to play against each other in either singles or doubles matches. You can also play in an exhibition or tournament mode.
