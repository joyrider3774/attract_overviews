Game Boy Color installment in Codemasters' TOCA racing franchise. Fight the pack to gain position without losing control of your car as you race on nine different original tracks of the British Touring Car Championships (TOCA). The developers worked hard to program real-world physics into the gameplay. Though running on the Game Boy Color hardware, the game manages to display up to eight cars simultaneously onscreen. Features include eight different game modes, such as single race, championship, time trial, and party play.
