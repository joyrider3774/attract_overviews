Halloween becomes a year-round treat with THE SIMPSONS: Night of the Living Treehouse of Horror. Based on the annual SIMPSONS Halloween specials, this lighthearted game allows you to play as anyone in the family: Bart, Lisa, Homer, Marge, or little Maggie. Each character has been drawn into a haunted world, and it's up to you to steer them home. There are six spooky levels in all, and each one of them is packed with chills and challenges for gamers of all ages. SIMPSONS aficionados are sure to get a kick out of all the cameos Principal Skinner, Krusty the Clown, Moe the Bartender, Barney, and plenty of others make appearances. The game successfully marries the hilarious antics of the Springfield regulars with some surprisingly exciting gameplay to yield a game that's as much fun to play as a SIMPSONS episode is to watch. You don't have to be a total series addict to get into this rollicking gem.
