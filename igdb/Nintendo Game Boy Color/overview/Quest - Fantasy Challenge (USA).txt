As you're leaving a party at the castle, you're suddenly attacked by a swarm of evil monsters. Now you must fight your way through the monsters to get home. In each of the 20 levels, you must collect gems and open chests that are scattered throughout. However, there are a large number of enemies on your tail including Hellhounds, Apophis, Bumbershoot, Rocky, Skeletons, and Scorpions. Luckily, you have a magic wand that will destroy them, but there's a catch it must recharge between shots. There are also a multitude of power-ups like Fresh Bread, Mint Leaves, Honey Leaves, Dew Drops, Spirit Light, Healing Potion, Heroes Drink and the Dragon's Potion that will help you along the way. Try to collect all of the items and get home safely in QUEST FANTASY CHALLENGE.
