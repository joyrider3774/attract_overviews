Buckle up and get ready to race! Rally across America with Mickey and friends! Race around 20 All-American courses - from Alaska to the Everglades - as you try to track down the Weasels and rescue poor dognapped Pluto. Use Ludwig Von Drake's wacky weapons - such as the "Antigrav-o-Kit Magno Flyer" or the "Stormy Weather Whenever Engager" - to give you the edge. Then blast past your friends and listen as the drivers taunt each other using Disney's original character voices!
