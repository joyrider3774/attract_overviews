Bursting with stunning realism and high-excitement baseball action, Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest drives home the winning run! Improved player animations and color commentary by Dave Niehaus - "The Voice of the Mariners" - make you feel like you're really at the game, while easy-to-use controls, updated rosters and statistics, and an optional fantasy draft make it even more fun than being there!
