The player who revolutionized the sport of golf returns to the PlayStation in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2000. This sequel to Tiger Woods'99 has been designed from the ground up for fun and easy accessibility. Finding the green is a breeze with an innovative swing design: pressing the X button or deftly manipulating the analog joystick simulates your swing. Only have time for a quick round of golf? An entire 18-hole course can be enjoyed in only 30 minutes. In addition to Tiger Woods, an enlarged roster of licensed PGA tour pros like Mark O'Meara and Davis Love III are here to choose from. Select from expanded modes of play including Practice, Tournament, Skins, Fourball, Foursomes, and Shootout Mode. Compete on many different, lushly rendered, real life golf courses (including Las Colinas, Poppy Hills, and The Badlands) and listen to helpful and often humorous comments from Tiger himself. You also get updated graphics that display wind direction and show you how the ball lies. Whether you're a big time golf fan or a complete novice, there's much to savor here.
