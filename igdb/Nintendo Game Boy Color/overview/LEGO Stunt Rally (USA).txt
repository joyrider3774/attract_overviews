LEGO STUNT RALLY on Game Boy Color is a racer with a leg up on the competition! As in many racers, your goal is to get to the finish line first in order to win fame and fortune or at least a few first-place medals. However, LEGO has always been about building, and LEGO STUNT RALLY is no different. You'll have to construct each of the tracks yourself using a variety of pieces containing curves, stunt pieces, and others. There are four different track themes, each with their own pieces: you can create a city track, a desert track, a mud track, and an ice track. Once you've built the track, it's time to race! Your competitors on the track will fight tooth and nail to beat you to the finish, so you'd better make sure you use the knowledge of the track's setup to your strategic advantage. If you manage to do well enough, you may uncover some new track themes. LEGO STUNT RALLY is for one player only, and is only compatible with Game Boy Color systems.
