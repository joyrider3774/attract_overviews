Bunches of dice are falling from the sky, and it's up to you to arrange them the right way! In the grand tradition of puzzle classics like TETRIS and DR. MARIO comes this white-knuckle test of your reflexes. Replacing the usual bunch of plummeting shapes with six-sided dice, ROX adds an element of dominoes into the mix. Your real moment-to-moment challenge is to match one die with another, using the pair to eliminate the dice that lie in between the two.
