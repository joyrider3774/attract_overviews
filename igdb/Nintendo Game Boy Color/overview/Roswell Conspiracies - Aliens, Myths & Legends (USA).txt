Aliens have lived among mankind for centuries. However, man has known them as vampires, banshees, werewolves, and other mythical creatures. It is up to Global Alliance agent Nick Logan to stop these aliens from hunting humans and send them back to their home planets. Take control of Logan as he travels through 10 levels of action, spanning five exotic locations. In each level, Nick must master new technology to capture the aliens. If an alien tries to make a run for it, Logan can chase after it in a variety of vehicles, including a truck and a Humvee. In all of this action, he must avoid harming innocent human bystanders, who are unaware of the alien presence. Help Logan keep the aliens from feeding on humans in ROSWELL CONSPIRACIES: Aliens, Myths, & Legends.
