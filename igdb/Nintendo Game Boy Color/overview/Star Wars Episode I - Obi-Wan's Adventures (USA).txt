The Republic is in grave peril: the evil Trade Federation has Naboo in its clutches and all appears to be lost. The only hope is a lone Jedi Knight. In OBI WAN'S ADVENTURES, you take control of Obi Wan Kenobi and lead him through his treacherous battle to free the planet Naboo. 
 
Danger lurks around every corner in the form of Federation Droids and the nefarious Darth Maul. With lightsaber in hand and fueled by the power of the Force, Obi Wan will give his all to restore order to the Republic and eradicate the Sith Lord once and for all.
