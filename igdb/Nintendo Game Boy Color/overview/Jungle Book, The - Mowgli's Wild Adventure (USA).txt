In WALT DISNEY'S THE JUNGLE BOOK: Mowgli's Wild Adventure, you must guide Mowgli on an adventure to become King of the Jungle. Mowgli must work his way through more than 20 levels of adventure, using his superior intellect. Instead of beating up monkey guards, Mowgli can use a banana to lure them away from their posts. However, there will come a time when fighting is necessary, and the man-cub can use a number moves to get rid of the enemies including a butt-stomp and a vicious spin-attack. Since the game is optimized for the Game Boy Color, the environments look like they could have been taken right from the film. Help Mowgli survive to adulthood in WALK DISNEY'S THE JUNGLE BOOK: Mowgli's Wild Adventure.
