They might be small, but that doesn't mean they can't enjoy extreme sports like the pros! The whole ROCKET POWER gang makes its way from the small screen adventures of their Nickelodeon program to the even smaller screen of the Game Boy Color. Such favorite characters as Otto, Reggie, Twister, and Sam are along for the adventure which, you can bet, will have plenty of extreme sports in it! There are 10 wild levels of action, which will have you snowboarding, surfing, skateboarding, and more. A comprehensive password system will help you pick up progress right where you left off, and the animation is lifted straight from the frames of the television program. If you perform well enough, you might even make the front page of Reggie's Zine, a publication dedicated to the thrills of alternative sports. Packed with action, cutscenes, and tons of funny stuff, this is one thrill ride you'll never want to get off of.
