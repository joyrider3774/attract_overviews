Mean-hearted spirits control the River King and Sea King, the biggest fish in the world. Now an angel wants you and your brother to track down the elusive beasts, but your mission is anything but divine. First you'll need to fish for smaller fry to feed yourself and save up for top-notch tackle and rods, provided some animal doesn't make off with your catch of the day first. Legend of the River King 2 is a massive role-playing adventure that features all manner of angling from fresh water fly-fishing to deep sea trolling. A new trade mode allows you to trade your fish for produce with farmers in Harvest Moon GBC2!
