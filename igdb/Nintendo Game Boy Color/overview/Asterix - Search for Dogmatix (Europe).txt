If you have trouble choosing between an adventure game with a suspenseful, in-depth investigation and a game of skill made for joystick fanatics, "Asterix: search for Dogmatix" is just for you! 
 
If you play in "adventure" mode, you set out to search for Dogmatix in six worlds and 30 levels (taking you on journeys throughout Gaul, Egypt, Rome, etc.). And the dozen or so mini-games in "instant fun" mode are sure to keep your fingers busy between two stations on the underground. 
 
There's a catch, though: to access the whole set of mini-games, you have to win Bonus Tokens by playing in "adventure" mode. By Belenos, this is a game for the truly indomitable!
