Players take on the role of a spy in white (or black), and go on a mission to go to four different locations and collect 4 items: a CD, passport, key and a sum of cash (and a brief-case to contain these things). But there's a snatch, another spy is also on the same mission. Players have to sweep him out of their way and collect the items before he does!
