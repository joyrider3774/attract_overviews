What your enemy fears the most is something it cannot see: You! 
 
A mysterious army has attacked the land of Koga and stolen an ancient and sacred scroll. As a highly trained ninja, it's up to you to find out who is behind the trouble and recover Koga's precious treasure. To accomplish this, you'll need to recover six secret ninja tools hidden from the invaders. The enemy army may outnumber you a thousand to one, but you are a master of stealth-- and every military leader knows that a blind enemy is a vanquished foe.
