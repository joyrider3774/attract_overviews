MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY: Winners Circle for the Game Boy Color is a unique racing title that pits players against a plethora of obstacles while riding horseback. There are four different horses to choose from, each with a distinct look and style. Each horse has varying statistics for speed, jumping, and handling, requiring the player to make a careful choice to find the horse best-fitted to their racing style. Before riding you can also alter the clothing of the athlete to something of your choosing, then watch the changed sprite during gameplay.
