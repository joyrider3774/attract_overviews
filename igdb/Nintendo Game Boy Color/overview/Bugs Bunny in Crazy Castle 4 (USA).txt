Bugs Bunny returns in BUGS BUNNYS CRAZY CASTLE 4 for Game Boy Color! Thinking he has found the Carrot Castle, Bugs has once again entered the Crazy Castle. You must help him escape in this single-player action or puzzle game. This time, more than 60 rooms await Bugs, and he'll have to use all of his wits and skills to escape with his "hare" intact. Once again, the Crazy Castle is loaded with traps and hazards that will cut your carrot-collecting career short so make sure you don't get reacquainted with them the hard way. As CRAZY CASTLE fans are probably used to, several Warner Bros. cartoon characters are here to keep Bugs on his toes. You'll have to fight off Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepe Le Pew, Tweety, and the Tazmanian Devil with one of a variety of weapons, or make tracks to the nearest safe spot. A password save will chart your progress so that you don't have to start from scratch each time you play.
