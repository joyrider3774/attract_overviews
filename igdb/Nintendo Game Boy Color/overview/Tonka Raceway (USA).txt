Tonka trucks come to the Game Boy Color for some racing in TONKA RACEWAY. You can choose from four different vehicles including a dump truck, 4X4, racecar, and bulldozer. After you have chosen the perfect vehicle, get on one of the three tracks: "Tropical Paradise," "Scorching Desert," or the "Winter Wonderland." Your biggest challenge will be to try and stay off of the walls and in the lead. Once you cross the finish line, you receive points that you can use to upgrade your vehicle in four different areas: tires, shocks, turbo, and engine. Thanks to the built-in rumble capabilities, you will feel every bump and jolt in the game. Try to become a driving champion with TONKA RACEWAY.
