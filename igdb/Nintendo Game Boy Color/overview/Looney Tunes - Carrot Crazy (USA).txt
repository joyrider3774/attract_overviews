Coming home after a long day at work, Bugs and Lola find their garden ransacked and all of their carrots stolen. Now the two must explore the Warner Bros. Lot to discover the identity of the carrot thief. You guide the bunnies through five worlds, collecting carrots that will allow the characters use special powers like the ability to walk on thin air and using their ears as a helicopter propeller. The two can also collect Super Carrots that will allow them to use their powers longer and Habanero Carrots that make them invincible. The player must switch between the Bugs and Lola to solve puzzles with each character's special skills. Try to find the carrot thief in Looney Tunes: Carrot Crazy.
