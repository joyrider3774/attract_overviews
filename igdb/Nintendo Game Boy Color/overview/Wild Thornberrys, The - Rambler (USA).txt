The Wild Thornberrys are trying to win the Golden Schweitzer, an award given for the best nature documentary in the world. You take control of Nigel, Marianne, Eliza, Darwin, Debbie, and Donnie as they travel through six wacky levels of action. Along the way, they will have to travel to exotic locations like the Galapagos Islands, Amazon Rain Forest, Savannah Desert, African Congo, Himalayan Mountains, and Australian Outback. Each area has unique mini-games that can be set to three different difficulty levels. The games include sneaking up on animals and videotaping them, driving the Thornberry bus through the jungle, and helping Nigel collect items as he rappels down the side of a cliff. When you complete a game, the difficulty level determines what ending you see. Help the crew win the big award in THE WILD THRONBERRYS: Rambler.
