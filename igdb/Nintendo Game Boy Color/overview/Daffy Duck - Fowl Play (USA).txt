DAFFY DUCK: Fowl Play brings more Looney Tunes fun and action to your Game Boy Color. In this one-player, side-scrolling action game, you'll play as Daffy Duck, who's been told by Bugs Bunny about a secret hidden treasure. Your job is to find it! Too bad Bugs and the rest of the Looney Tunes crew have decided to stop your treasure-hunting journey cold. Play through nine stages of platforming action as you look to get rich quick. There are a few puzzle elements as well that require you to push crates and use dynamite sticks to clear a path. DAFFY DUCK: Fowl Play features large, well-animated characters set on detailed backgrounds, and although it has been enhanced for Game Boy Color, this game is compatible with both Game Boy and Game Boy Color systems.
