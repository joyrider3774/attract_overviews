Dragon Quest Monsters 2 followed Pokemon's strategy of releasing 2 games with exclusive monsters that would need to be traded between versions to collect them all.

The games were later re-released along with the first Dragon Quest Monsters as a compilation for the PlayStation and the games were later remade for the 3DS, but only in Japan.
