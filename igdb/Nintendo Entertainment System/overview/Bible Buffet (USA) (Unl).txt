Bible Buffet is an unlicensed game created by Wisdom Tree for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is a single player or multiplayer game. The primary goal is to stop the oil drums and the silverware whose goal is to kill the player.
Similar to Candy Land, this game has the player spin a spinner to move a specified amount of spaces told by the spinner to move. The regular space is the player's own space, red space indicates another spin, a red circle connected to another red circle has the player move one step forward or backward. If the space has a red circle with a question mark in it, the player can take a pop quiz of three trivia questions and then, if succeeded, gets to select either a key, a heart or move ahead one-four spaces, along with the prize of winning a star. If the player lands on the happy face, something rewarding happens such as moving ahead ten spaces, getting a key, heart etc. If the sad face is landed on, something unrewarding happens, including a loss of a turn, moving back a space, etc. At the end of the game, a bonus is awarded to the player who got to the end first and/or got the most pop quiz stars aside collecting the most food. After that, the entire amount of points is shown to each player.
