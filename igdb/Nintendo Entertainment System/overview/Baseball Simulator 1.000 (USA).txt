Baseball Simulator 1.000 was made by Culture Brain exclusively for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Released in 1989, it was praised by Electronic Gaming Monthly as the "Best Sports-Themed Video Game" of 1989. This was largely due to some unique gameplay features that helped it to set itself apart from the many other baseball games released.
