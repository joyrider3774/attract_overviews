A "Star Wars" satellite has been snatched out of orbit, the world edges toward nuclear oblivion, and the CIA and KGB are blaming each other. Golgo 13 is back just in time. The Mafat Conspiracy is a phantasmagora of action and interaction. Your eyeballs will stretch from their sockets as you speed through Europe in Golgo's Ferrari. Your bones will rattle as you leap across the cars on the Orient Express. And if you think you've seen bad dudes, wait till you feel the power of Duke Togo's wicked karate kick. The Mafat Conspiracy is for those who demand the very best in video games!
