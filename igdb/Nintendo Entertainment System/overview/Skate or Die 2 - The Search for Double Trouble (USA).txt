The good, the rad, the airborne! Get into double trouble! The twisted adventure. The ultimate ramp. Newspaper headlines scream: "Punk flattens Mayor's poodle... Ramp demolished... Local skateboarding suffers!" Now whaddaya do? Scour sewers and alleys. Score hot moves and boards from Rodney and Lester. Scrape together the ramp plans blowin' down the beach. Nail the homeboys with stink-eggs and paint pellets. If you skate, you can relate.
