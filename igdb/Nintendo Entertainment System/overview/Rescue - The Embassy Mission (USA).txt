A diplomatic mission in a foreign city is seized by political fanatics. Innocent lives are in jeopardy. Outrageous demands are being made for their safety. Only you and your elite crisis intervention team can rescue the ambassador and his helpless staff. Position your sharpshooters around the embassy's perimeter. Focus your sights on the curtained windows. Squeeze off rounds of cover fire to protect your assault squad. Once your men are inside, an electronic diagram of the building's floor plan provides your only guide down to the captives - and the awaiting enemy. Look sharp. Stay frosty. Rescue is an interactive action-adventure game that lets you control each member of your strike team through three different game scenarios. Avoid searching spotlights, dodge enemy gunfire, rappel down walls, and smash through windows. Neutralize your adversaries and liberate the embassy personnel!
