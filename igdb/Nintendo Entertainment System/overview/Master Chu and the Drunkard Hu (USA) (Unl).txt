Return to a mythical time in the Far East, when the legendary Siamese-Twin Shiva, God of Destruction, cursed your village with fearsome evil spirits. Despaired by repeated failures to drive out Shiva's evil demons, your best friend, Master Hu, has turned into a drunkard. You, Master Chu, must search through hostile palaces and temples to find and destroy this four-armed incarnation of Shiva. If you would like, just ask your teammate, the Drunkard Hu, to help out. Playing together can be a lot of fun!
