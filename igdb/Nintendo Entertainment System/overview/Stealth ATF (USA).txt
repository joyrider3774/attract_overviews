Stealth ATF is a flight simulator in which you pilot a F-117A, a.k.a. Nighthawk in several missions. 
 
In every mission's beginning and ending you have to take off and land your plane respectively, from a side view. If you fail to land after completing the target objectives, you fail to succeed in mission and thus have to replay it.
