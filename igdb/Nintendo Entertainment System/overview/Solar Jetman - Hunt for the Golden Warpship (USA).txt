Blasting off through the cosmos and into hostile alien terrain, Jetman has returned in his most ambitious adventure yet! After the most powerful spacecraft in the known Universe, the Golden Warpship, is disassembled by a band of ruthless Space Pirates and scattered throughout the galaxy, Solar Jetman is tasked with rebuilding the ship to its former glory. Aided only by the gargantuan Federation Mothership for refuelling, Jetman will have to explore twelve labyrinthine planets solo in his Jetpod, where opposition is hidden inside every cavern and beyond every crater. With survival running as thin as his fuel, Solar Jetman will need to ward off every potential invasion and escape with the Golden Warpship intact â€“ only then can he face off against his largest interstellar foe yet!

Solar Jetman was re released as part of the Rare Replay Collection on Xbox One
