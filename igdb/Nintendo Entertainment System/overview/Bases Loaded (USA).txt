Bases Loaded is a baseball game that was released for Arcade and the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1987. It was developed by Jaleco and TOSE, and was the first installment in the Bases Loaded series, which was followed by seven sequels for three generations of consoles. The game tried to focus on the confrontation between the pitcher and the batter, putting emphasis on the face-off between the two. Unfortunately, this made the perspective fairly limited in determining where to hit the ball, or even where the ball was during a pitch.
