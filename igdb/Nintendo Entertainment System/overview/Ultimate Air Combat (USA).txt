Ultimate Air Combat has 36 different missions, then one last final mission. Each mission is grouped into two parts. The first part uses a cockpit view where the player must shoot down three planes before either running out of fuel or getting shot down by enemy planes. After that, the second half of the mission uses an isometric view where the player must destroy enemy forces and installations.
