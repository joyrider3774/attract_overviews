Little League Baseball! It's the game every kid in America loves to play... And now you can experience the fun and excitement of Little League Baseball at any time of the year, rain or shine, day or night - right in your own living room!

You are in full control of your players: Jump or dive for a tricky catch... Choose a full swing or a bunt for your batter... Shift fielders at will... Send in a pinch hitter or runner... Select a fast ball, slow ball, or curve ball for your pitcher... Steal a base if you dare... Or you might even try a squeeze play!
