There is a lot more to this soccer game than meets the eye... Compete in a tournament, play against the computer or your friend, or even watch the computer play both teams. In the event of a tie, you get to do a real penalty kick play-off. You can choose your team from among 24 different countries, and give the team the qualities you like. Figure out your strategy before the game and set your formation. Winning depends on your skill... and a little bit of luck!
