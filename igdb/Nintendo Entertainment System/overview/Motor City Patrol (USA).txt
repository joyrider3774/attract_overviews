You are one of MotorCity's finest performing your regular duties: patrolling every street, making routine arrests, issuing tickets, and setting up speed traps. Suddenly the calm is broken! There's a crime in progress and you're the first to respond. You contact the helicopter patrol who's already on the scene. Time is of the essence. Using your surveillance map, you find the best route to the scene of the crime just in time to make the collar. It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it!
