Journey to Silius, known in Japan as Rough World is a side-scrolling run and gun video game developed by Tokai Engineering and published by Sunsoft for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990.
Journey to Silius was originally based on the 1984 film The Terminator, but the licensing rights to the film were lost during development. As a result, the graphics and storyline were altered to accommodate this change, but remnants of the earlier version still remain in the game. For example, the final boss has a striking resemblance to the titular terminator in the film.
