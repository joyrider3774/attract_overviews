Barker Bill's Trick Shooting was developed and published by Nintendo for the NES in 1990. It was loosely based on the cartoon show "Barker Bill's Cartoon Show", popular in the 1950s. The game is essentially a shooting gallery taking place in a carnival, utilizing Nintendo's Zapper gun. It was relatively successful, but was not regarded as a breakthrough game.
