Venice Beach Volleyball is no doubt the coolest video game under the hot summer sun. Check it out! We took miles of clear blue sky, warm sand, along with millions of gnarly 8-foot waves, mixed in dudes, babes, and one ton of pure fun, then crammed the whole thing with the maximum amount of challenge and excitement allowable by federal law. Here you have it, the most excellent beach volleyball game ever! Locals say kicking the butt of a computer controlled team is never easy without a lot of practice. You haven't seen anything until you challenge a friend head to head in competitive double player action mode. Way rad beach volleyball action, blazing 8-bit graphics and killer tunes. That's what VENICE BEACH VOLLEYBALL is all about!
