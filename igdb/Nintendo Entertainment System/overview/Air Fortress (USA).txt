Air Fortress is a video game published in Japan for the Nintendo Entertainment System released in Japan in 1987 and later in North America in 1989. Only a total of 385 copies of the game were shipped to the United States in 1987, and it is believed that only 20 were shipped beforehand as a test run for the system. Within PAL-A regions, it was only released in Australia. This makes the American version of the game very rare.
