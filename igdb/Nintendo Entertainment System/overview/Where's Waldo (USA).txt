Your goal is to find Waldo in various pictures in order to progress through the game. 
 
The pictures are still images the size of the screen in the Easy and Practice levels. In the Medium and Hard levels, the player has to scroll to the side to see the rest of the area. The directional buttons control a magnifying glass and once the player finds Waldo, they get to go to the next level and a new picture.
