You're about to find out just what's involved for a young bee with a day-job. Gigantic spiders, sneaky ants and loathsome slugs are just a few of the meanies who'll get in your way when you're bee number 52. You're hardly defenseless though, and with enough speed, skill and firepower you may get through the day - despite being heavily outnumbered. Let your nose, or rather proboscis, lead the way to the flowers and don't let anyone - or anything - get in your way! B52 - you're cleared for take off!
