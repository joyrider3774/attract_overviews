This game is set in a free-roaming environment. The game's world comprises interconnected areas which consist of outdoor sections, caves, water, and other thematic places with platform structures and wandering enemies. Similarly to The Dragon's Trap, the player is theoretically able to explore this world from the beginning; however, many areas are too hazardous or impossible to traverse when the player controls only one character with his limited abilities.
