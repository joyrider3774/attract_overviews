The game centers around the main character of Apollo (no relation to the Greek sun god) who progresses through the game in an alternating format that switches between platform, side-scrolling action (similar to the Super Mario Bros. series) and side-scrolling shooter action (similar to Konami's Gradius series). The goal of the series is, stereotypically, to destroy an evil boss — Goruza — rescue a princess — in this case, Princess Maria — and save the planet.
