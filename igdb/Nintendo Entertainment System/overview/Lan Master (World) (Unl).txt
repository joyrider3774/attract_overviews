Lan Master is a puzzle game for NES, inspired by the game NetWalk. The goal is to connect all of the computers on each level. Rotate the pieces and connect the wires before the timer runs out! There are fifty levels in all, with increasing difficulty. A password system is included so whether youâ€™re playing in an emulator or on a console, you can come back later and pick up where you left off.
