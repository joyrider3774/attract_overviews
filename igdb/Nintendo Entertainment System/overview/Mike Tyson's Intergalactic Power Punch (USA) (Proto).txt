Mike Tyson is the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world, with an Olympic gold medal and a 33-0 (30 KO) record to his claim. After knocking out another opponent with ease, Tyson and his manager taunt the world by saying that no one can stop him. However, the broadcast is picked up far from Earth in the outer reaches of the universe by an alien boxing promoter for the Intergalactic Boxing Federation (IGBF). The promoter decides to accept Tyson’s challenge that he can beat “anyone”. Thus Tyson is brought into the throes of the universe to compete against the best boxers in the universe and defend his earthly title.
