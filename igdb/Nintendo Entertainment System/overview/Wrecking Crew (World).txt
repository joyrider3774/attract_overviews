Wrecking Crew is a platform action game for one or two players. The player controls Mario (Player 2 as Luigi) working on a demolition site. The goal is to break down all of the stone walls on each stage. The game features a custom level maker, where players can make their own Wrecking Crew levels. The game had the ability to save those custom levels. However, the required peripherals (the keyboard and Data Recorder accessories) were released only in Japan.
