Lunar Pool is the first advanced home video billiards game ever. Never before has the player been able to choose among 60 different "tables." Jump around to your favorite, or master each stage consecutively. Your score is kept automatically. You set up the electronic cue stick, aim the cue ball, choose the power you need and shoot! Then watch the ball ricochet around the "table" and land in the pocket. Learn to be a "hustler" by mastering all 60 stages!
