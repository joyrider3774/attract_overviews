Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm have wandered away from home and it looks like Fred and Barney found them. Unfortunately, an active volcano stands in the way. Now, Fred and Barney must travel across the pre-hysterical world of Bedrock to rescue the kids! Fred swings a mean club and Barney's sling carries a nasty sting in this adventure for the whole family. Scale the side of a cliff, use crocodiles as trampolines, and leap into action as Bedrock's most famous citizens go looking for their children. Collect the hidden five fabled fire gemstones to pay a greedy Pterodactyl to return Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm to their homes!
