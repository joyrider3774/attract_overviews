It's the year 2006. You're Mark "Tough Guy" Tyler and you've just defended your Heavyweight title for the 9th consecutive time. After demolishing the best boxers on the planet, it's now time to face off with the best in the universe. The Intergalactic Boxing Federation (IGBF) has invited you to go head-to-head with 12 of their greatest fighters. From metallic cyborgs, to heavy hitting mutants, you'll trade punches with opponents whose strength, stamina and speed are like nothing you've ever seen. If pure technique doesn't stop these sluggers (and with the best of them it won't), get hold of those Power Punches. They'll guarantee to send your tin-coated opponent to the junkyard and you to a new title; undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the Universe!
