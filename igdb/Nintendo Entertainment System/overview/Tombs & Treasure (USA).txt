As you enter such sites as El Castillo and the Ball Court, you'll have to use collected items in innovative ways in order to attain vital clues and progress. Each screen you encounter will feature items and peculiarities that must been looked at, taken, pushed, pulled, moved, smashed, joined, and/or washed in order to advance. Occasionally, you will confront monsters and engage in a classic RPG-style fight, your final battle versus the demon Tentacula.
