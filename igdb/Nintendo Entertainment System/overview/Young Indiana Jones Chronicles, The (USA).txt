Here is your chance to become Young Indiana Jones, as you set out to single-handedly save the world from the Kaiser's war machine. In this World War I epic, you'll battle through 19 stages of globe-spanning action, from the deserts of Mexico to the trenches on the Western front to the heart of the German headquarters. You'll take on Pancho Villa and Big Bertha, battle tanks and tri-planes and team up with Canadian flying ace Billy Bishop in a dogfight against the Red Baron.
