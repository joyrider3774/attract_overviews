Your shuttle commander has been trapped in a dimensional maze in space, and you must use your glove to throw an energy ball at the walls in order to advance. 
 
The walls in each maze room you encounter are filled with blocks. Using your Power Glove, you have to entirely break down a wall before being allowed to advance to the next room.
