Taboo: The Sixth Sense is a Tarot card reading simulation developed by Rare Ltd. and published by Tradewest for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1989.
This video game gives users a tarot reading where the "dealer" automatically shuffles the cards. It is the only NES game to carry two warnings; that it is intended for players ages fourteen and older and the game is intended for entertainment purposes only. Taboo was marketed as a party game that multiple adults could enjoy simultaneously.
