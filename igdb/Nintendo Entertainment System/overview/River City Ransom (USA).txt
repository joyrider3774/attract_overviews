Hear the message from Sick, the meanest ganglord in town: "I hold your high school captive, and some of the students will have a trying moment, if they're ever fool enough to cross my path!" But you aren't afraid of anybody! Face the terrible gangs and neutralize their bosses, in order to deliver the city from terror!
