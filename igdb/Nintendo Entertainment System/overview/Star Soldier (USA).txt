A strange and evil presence is lurking in space. Crushing everything in its path, destroying spaceships full of innocent people, the brutal Starbrain is threatening the entire Galactic Empire. Starbrain, a giant computer programmed only for destruction, inhabits an enormous space station, guarded by enemy ships and robot creatures. To penetrate the station is a job for the most skillful and experienced Star Soldier - you! You'll be piloting Caesar, the fastest fighter ship in the Galactic Fleet, with an awesome arsenal of weapons at your finger-tips. Only you can end the fearsome Starbrain's spree of destruction, and restore peace to the galaxy!
