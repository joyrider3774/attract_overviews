The game is set in Krynn, world of the Dragonlance saga, during the War of the Lance. DragonStrike combined elements of computer role-playing games and flight simulators. The player character is a knight who flies on the back of a metallic dragon equipped with a lance and various magic items (among other things a magic orb that acts as a radar in the game).
