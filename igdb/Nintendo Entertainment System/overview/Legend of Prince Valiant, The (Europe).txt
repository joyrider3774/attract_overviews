The quest to find the legendary Viking Ring of Peace begins in treacherous marshland, where every step is potentially lethal. Armed with a mere crossbow, the prince must fight his way through a vast forest, inhabited with cut throats and thieves, down into the underground caverns, through the deadly maze to the ring's resting place. Now he must cross the stormy sea and battle the hostile viking armada to reach Camelot. Arthur's Hall lies beyond the labyrinthine maze of corridors and passageways...will Prince Valiant make it and fulfil his dream of knighthood?
