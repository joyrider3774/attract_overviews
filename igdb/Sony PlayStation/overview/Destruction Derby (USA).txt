With no rules, no limits and no pit stopping, anything goes in this collision course of crumple zones, hit & run mayhem, and street level slamming where wrecking your opponent's motor in ultra-realistic smashes and crashes is the name of the game. Take on the rigors of a full Championship season and pit your wits against a motley crew of psycho-waster racers such as the Suicide Squaddies, Skum and The Optician as you storm up the rankings from Rookie to Pro.

Reckon you can handle it?

Destruction Derby works with a serial link cable for two player head-to-head action.
