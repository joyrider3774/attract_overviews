A terrifying new device has just been developed...One that could tip the scale of combat in the favour of the side which controls it. This new device was created by the "Critical Path Corporation", under the orders of their president, "Manfred Brando". The device has the ability to jam all Weapon Systems rendering them utterly useless. 
 
The terrorist group that attacked the colonies is known as the "Black Ravens", led by their fearless leader "Timoshie Daldahnton"...Codenamed the "All Kill Wizard". Their goal is to rule the galaxy, and the only thing standing in their way is the combined might of the U.N Spacy forces. This new device could change that... 
 
As Ace Pilot, "Aegis Focker", it is up to you and the VFX Raven's "Alpha Squadron", to defend the colonists from the terrorists and stop them from using the device to annihilate the U.N forces. You will get to pilot the most advanced Variable Fighters in the U.N arsenal, and fly into the face of danger with your wingmen right beside you. However, things are not as they seem...There is a traitor among the ranks, someone who sympathizes with the terrorists, and has a hidden agenda of their own...Who could it be?...Your mission controller?, your wingmen?, your captain?...maybe even your commander?
