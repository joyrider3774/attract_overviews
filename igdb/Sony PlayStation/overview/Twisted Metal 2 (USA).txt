The gameâ€™s gameplay is very similar to that of its predecessor. However, Twisted Metal 2 does feature many new notable gameplay mechanics. One addition is vehicle-common advanced moves. These moves allow players to press button combinations in order to perform special rechargeable maneuvers such as cloak , shield, and a napalm blast. Cars can catch on fire after being attacked with weapons such as napalm, which will slowly deteriorate their health. Health pick-ups allow players to heal themselves in a more sensible fashion than that of the first game.
