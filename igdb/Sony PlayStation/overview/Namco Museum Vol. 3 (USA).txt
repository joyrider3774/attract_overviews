The third PlayStation volume contains: 
Galaxian (1979) 
Ms. Pac-Man (1981) 
Dig Dug (1982) 
Phozon (1983) 
Pole Position II (1983) 
The Tower of Druaga (1984) 
 
The majority of the included games were well-known worldwide but Phozon and The Tower of Druaga were relatively unknown. Two unique versions of The Tower of Druaga were also hidden in this volume: one called "Another Tower", and the other called "Darkness Tower". Both are harder than the original and require different methods to beat the game.
