Tranquillizer Gun is a 1980 arcade game developed by Sega for VIC Dual hardware. It has the player control a hunter, who must make his way around a maze, shooting animals and dragging their bodies back to his truck. 
 
The game was brought to the SG-1000 as Safari Hunting by a then-just founded Compile with slightly updated graphics. It was also included as a minigame within Dynamite Cop.
