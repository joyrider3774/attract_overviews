Sega Flipper is a pinball game released for the SG-1000 in 1983. In New Zealand it is known as Video Flipper. 
 
It was one of the first pinball video games to be released, being released one year earlier than attempts from Jaleco and Nintendo but four years after Atari's Video Pinball. Unlike Video Pinball, however, Sega Flipper makes use of color.
