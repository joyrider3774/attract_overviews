Othello (オセロ) is a SG-1000 video game based on the board game Othello. 
 
Two versions of Othello exist for the SG-1000. The first version, released in 1983, was built into the Othello Multivision (which is where the system gets its name from). Sega would later re-release this game in cartridge form in 1985, offering significant graphical and AI improvements over Tsukuda Original's version.
