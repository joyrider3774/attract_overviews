Safari Race is a racing game for the SG-1000, developed and published by Sega in 1984. The player must drive through various "sections", avoiding wildlife and other cars while making sure not to run out of fuel. 
 
The game is notable for using licensed cars, potentially the first video game to do so. The player controls a Lancia Stratos HF, and according to the box art, some of the rival cars are Audi Quattros. The Lancia Stratos would receive greater video game recognition in Sega's later creation Sega Rally Championship.
