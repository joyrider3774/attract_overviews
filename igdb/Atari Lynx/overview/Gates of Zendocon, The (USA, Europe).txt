The hideous spider Zendocon captured you and sent you deep into its web of 51 deadly universes. You must survive each universe and its hostile alien inhabitants if you hope to return home. 
You will find allies along the way. If you can free Zendocon's alien slaves, they will help you search for the Gates that will transport you from one universe to the next. 
Can you survive Zendocon's challenge? You must survive! Your rewards for success is the chance for sweet revenge--a duel to the death with the evil spider itself!
