Air Boarder 64 is a futuristic racing game for the Nintendo 64. It is very similar to the Tony Hawks Pro Skater series, allthough the game features hover boards instead of the usual skateboards. Various game modes are available in which you either have to win the race challenges or get a high score by performing different tricks.
