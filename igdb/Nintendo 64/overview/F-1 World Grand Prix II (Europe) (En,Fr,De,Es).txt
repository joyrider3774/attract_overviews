F1 WGP 2 pretty much sports the same features as the first game. The game has 4 modes of play: the championship season mode, the exhibition race, time trials, and the challenge mode. R and Z are used to shift gears, the analog stick is used to steer the car, A is the accelerator and B is the brake. The C-buttons allow for camera changes and backmirror views. It's pretty much the same setup and how these work are pretty much unchanged from the first game to the second.
