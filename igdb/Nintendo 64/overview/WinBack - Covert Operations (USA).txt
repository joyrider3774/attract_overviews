In one of the first cover-based shooters you play as a secret operative,  Jean-Luc Cougar, infiltrating a laser satellite's command center taken over by terrorists. The game is centered around the cover system, with a stop-and-pop kind of gameplay style as you can't move while shooting. It also has a long series of the different boss scenarios where different tactics need to be applied to defeat them. There is a time element to the campaign where depending on how fast the player reaches the control room - the endings will differ. 

WinBack can be seen as a predecessor to games like Gears of War.
