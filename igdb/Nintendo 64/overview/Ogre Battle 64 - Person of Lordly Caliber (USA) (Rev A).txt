"Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Caliber is a tactical RPG for the Nintendo 64.

Featuring a gripping storyline with multiple possible endings, and a genre-defining character class system, this strategic epic has rightly retained its place in the hearts of tactical RPG fans for over a decade.

The game tells the story of Magnus Gallant, a recently graduated officer of the Palatinean Army who is assigned to the troubled southern region of his native land. There he witnesses the plight of the lower classes â€“ the victims of a tyrannical ruling elite whose only thought is for the preservation of their own lofty status. With civil war brewing, Magnus is faced with a terrible choice: to betray his own noble origins in the name of liberty, or turn a blind eye to the evils of his rotten society."
