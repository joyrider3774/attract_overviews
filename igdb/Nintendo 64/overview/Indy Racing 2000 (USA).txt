INDY RACING 2000 for the Nintendo 64 combines realistic racing simulations and far-out arcade racers to make a game that closely follows the rules, but is still a lot of fun to play. There are many modes such as Practice, Race, Competition, and Championship. Before each race, the player can choose one of 20 real-life drivers and their actual vehicle. Players also have the ability to customize the car as desired, by adjusting everything from the tire pressure to the transmission. In addition to the official Indy Racing League tracks, there are road courses to race on as well. Players will have to race their hardest, as the cartridge will save all of their racing data so that they can compare their stats to a friend, or even race one in the Multiplayer mode. INDY RACING 2000 manages to keep the franchise fresh by offering plenty of tracks and options, with great racing fun in the lead.
