Winnie the Pooh needs YOU! How can he throw a party without honey? Play as Tigger and run, jump, and bounce around the 100 Acre Wood in search of Pooh's "most favorite" snack. Along the journey there'll be plenty of challenges - blustery blowing leaves to ride, icy terrain, falling boulders, menacing bees, pesky bats and more. Earn Tigger's very special "Tiggertastic Bounce" as a bonus!
