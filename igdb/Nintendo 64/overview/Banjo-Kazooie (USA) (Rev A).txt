In this 3D platformer, the heroic but naive bear Banjo enlists his cowardly bird buddy Kazooie to help rescue his younger sister from a vain, beauty-stealing witch. The player is tasked with exploring the witch's lair and the nine large, open levels within it, looking for tasks and challenges to complete. Along the way they meet a variety of characters who teach them new moves and transform them into different animals. Modeled after Super Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie is distinguished by its cheeky and sarcastic sense of humor and by a large, varied, and novel moveset.
