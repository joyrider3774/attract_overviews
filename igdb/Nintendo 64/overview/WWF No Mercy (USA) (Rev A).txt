THQ's second WWF and fifth wrestling game for the N64 will feature enhanced customization options, a whopping 80 snarling gladiators and Transfer Pak links with two GBC-only WWF games.

Associate producer Mike Sparks boasts of a "guest referee" mode, in which any wrestler can ajudicate the action or start whacking away at the rivals at any time, and a novel "Smackdown Mall." Points earned by mastering the still-unnamed GBC Paks will be needed to buy costume items, unlock wrestlers and get other goodies.
