After watching middle age British men grappling each on a Saturday afternoon in the 70s, along came a bigger, brighter and louder version of wrestling from the USA. It was called WWF and now is your chance to participate. 
 
There are no options, you are just thrown straight into the action. The game is viewed from the side showing the whole of the ring. You can punch or kick your opponent. If you get into a grapple then you have to waggle your joystick left and right as fast as you can. The winner picks up the other fighter and throws him to the canvas. You are also able to climb a corner post and jump on the other fighter.
