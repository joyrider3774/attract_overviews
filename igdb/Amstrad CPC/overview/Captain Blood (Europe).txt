Five clones scattered throughout the galaxy, draining your life force. You must find and assimilate them before the ship's auto-bionic functions take over completely... and render you inhuman. 
 
Death-defying flights through hyperspace and dangerous terrain lead to strange worlds with alien inhabitants: Migrax, Croolis-Ulv, and the beautiful and beguiling Torka. They have the information you need to find and destroy your clones- if you're clever enough to get it.
