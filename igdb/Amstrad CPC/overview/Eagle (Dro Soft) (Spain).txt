The sides of the cabinet are decorated with huge stickers of a ship breaking into three parts orbiting a dish-shaped planet. The word "EAGLE" is written in large letters diagonally across most of the side with round alien ships placed around it. 
 
The control panel has an overlay sticker containing docking instructions and labels for the left, right, and one/two player start buttons. Pictures of asteroids and a planet also decorate control panel. 
 
The marquee has a different, older-looking tri-stage ship with little planets and alien ships scattered around. The word EAGLE is positioned on the right hand side with what looks like wings on each side. 
 
The game was also released as a cabaret. This cabinet has a different overlay than the upright, the title appears on the front bottom of the overlay with the wing design, there is a small spaceship on the right side, and there is no ship on top of the control panel.
