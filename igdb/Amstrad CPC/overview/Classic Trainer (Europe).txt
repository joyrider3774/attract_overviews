Classic Trainer allows you to own five horses and race them over various seasons with the aim to win The Derby at the end of each season. Each season lasts 20 weeks with the choice of three races in a meeting every week if you choose to race a horse. You start the game with Â£5000 and before a meeting you have various options for your horses and yourself which cost you money and they are giving them a workout, treating injuries, getting a loan and retaining a jockey. Once you are happy with your selections you are then shown your horses and their fitness, class and race stats, you also have the option to sell a horse.
