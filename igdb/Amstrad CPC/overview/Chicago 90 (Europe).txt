Chicago 90 is an Action/racing game developed by Microids in 1989 which provides two game modes : one can play both gangsters and policemen with two different goals and strategies. In the "gangsters mode", you simply have to escape the city while avoiding the cops. In the "police mode", you have to control 5 police cars in order to prevent the gangsters from escaping the city and arrest them. Those two modes give some diversity to the game although its expectancy is a little short.
