Cecil Pitt and his sidekick, Clive, desperate to get out of the circus theatrics business turn to the world of rock music management. At start player can choose to hire up to four musicians to make up the band. There are a lot of musicians avaible, parodies of 80/90's pop music stars. Their weekly wage depends on their abilities and their fame, ranging from £30,000 for "Bill Collins" down to just £50 for "Sidney Sparkle" but there are other caricatures based on real-life rock and popstars, such as Madonna, Lemmy, Michael Jackson, Freddie Mercury, Cyndi Lauper and Elton John and much more. Player will need to be as quick as possible with coaching them into properly sellable artists. You need to write songs, release singles, videos and albums, along with doing publicity stunts and touring different sorts of venues. The game's ultimate goal is to get four gold records within a year.
