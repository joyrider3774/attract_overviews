The game of power. Profit. Double-Dealing and Deceit. 
 
You're on the fast track. At last, a partnership in the firm. With perks... new car, new office, new secretary. This is the life. 
 
Wake up. This is the real world. The underworld. The city of London, where high-finance and low double deals are commonplace. Where drugs, gambling and big money talk. And you? You find yourself the victim of a frame-up... the chief suspect in an insider trading scandal. And to survive, you have to be as devious, if not more so, than the rest.
