Kikstart 2 is a motorcycle trials racing videogame released for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. It enjoyed more success than its predecessor, Kikstart. The game allowed 2-player simultaneous (via a split-screen facility) or 1-player, vs-computer play. The game mechanics were copied into other games too, like the Game Boy game "Motocross Maniacs". 
 
The basic premise of the game is to control a bike using acceleration, braking, "hopping" and "wheelies" to navigate across a course of various obstacles, from ramps and gates to telephone boxes and tyres. 
 
The game was based on the BBC Television series Kick Start. An enhanced version was released for the Commodore 128,[1] one of the few native mode game titles for that computer.
