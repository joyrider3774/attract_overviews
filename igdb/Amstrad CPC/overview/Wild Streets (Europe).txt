The chief of Intelligence has been kidnapped. 
 
The CIA is counting on your natural survival skills and the hunter's instincts of the Black Panther, the magnificent predator trained especially for your protection, to go and find the Chief. 
 
Not just one man's life is at stake, but the complete CIA operations network is being undermined. 
 
Right now, the Mafia's terrorists are torturing their prisoner in order to get the names of the agents leading the fight against organised crime and drug dealing. 
 
Both you and your ally are deposited, by helicopter, near the spot where the Chief was last seen before his disappearance. 
 
Prepare yourself for a fight to the death, but remember to only use your gun when all else fails. 
 
You are accompanied by a black panther and a magnum 357 against an armada of punks, assassins and trained to kill hit men. 
 
You are the CIA's only hope..
