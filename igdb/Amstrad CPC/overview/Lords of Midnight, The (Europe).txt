The Lords of Midnight is an award winning adventure video game, written by Mike Singleton, and released in 1984 for the ZX Spectrum. Very well received from the beginning, it was soon converted for the Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64. The game featured an innovative 3-D effect that Singleton called landscaping, which served to bring the player into the game much more than usual. Lords of Midnight is often named with Elite as among the top role playing games of the 1980s.
