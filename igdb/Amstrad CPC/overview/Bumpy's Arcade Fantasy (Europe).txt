Bumpy, also known as Pop-Up and Cool-Ball, is a 2D platforming video game created by Loriciels. It was released for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC in 1989. In this game, the player controls a ball, trying to get it to the exit by bouncing it off walls and various types of platforms. Loriciels wanted a 16-bit game so they handed it over to Infogrames who made Pop-up in 1991. The loading screen and graphics changed but the music sound effects and gameplay remained the same.
