Times of Lore is a pleasant RPG set in the land of Albareth. You play either a Knight, a Barbarian, or a Valkyrie on a quest to search for the magical artifacts that will restore High King Valwyn to power. The game is played in real-time, similar to the Ultima series. The storyline, game play and battle system are simple. The graphics and sound are decent as well. This is a good little game that does not have too many puzzles and is just enjoyable to play with not much thinking.
