Special Operations is a top-down, turn based, tactical squad game where the player has to achieve a particular objective at an enemy compound. 
 
At the start of the game, the player selects the mission, with options as simple as photographing the compound to as difficult as blowing part of it up. Once the objective is selected, the player needs to select the squad members based upon their skills. Each potential squad member will have a primary skill and a secondary skill which is only revealed by interviewing the potential recruit. 
 
Certain skills are essential in order to complete your objective, for example a photographer and explosives expert for the example above and some are more generally useful, such as a diver which will let you explore any lakes that are encountered. 
 
Once the game begins you need to explore the forest in order to locate the compound or other elements that may help you complete the objective.
