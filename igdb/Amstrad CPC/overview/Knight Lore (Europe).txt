Although the third game in the Sabreman series, it was the first completed and withheld due to fears that sales of Sabre Wulf would be affected. 
 
The player, as Sabreman, has forty days to collect objects throughout a castle and brew a cure to his werewolf curse. He turns into a werewolf at night, as indicated by an onscreen timer, and returns to human form during the day. Each room is depicted in monochrome on its own screen and consists of blocks to climb and obstacles to avoid while the player solves puzzles and retrieves items for the cure.
