Palamedes II is a puzzle game and, as it sounds, the sequel to an obscure NES puzzler. The object is to throw one of the player’s dice at a die with the same number or one away. When you clear a die, it is added to the player’s poker-like “hand” and the bottom of the screen. When you’ve got a winning hand, you can use it clear multiple lines at once. The game has two modes: Mode 1 is a survival mode and Mode 2 is a screen-clear mode.
