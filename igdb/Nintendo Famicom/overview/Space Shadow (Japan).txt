A sci-fi Light Gun game from Bandai that came packaged with the Hyper Shot Light Gun for the Famicom. 
 
Space Shadow is an on-rails sci-fi Light Gun game from Bandai that takes its inspiration from the claustrophobic killer aliens movie Aliens. The player walks down an octagonal hallway and shoots any hostile extra-terrestrial life that bursts forth from one of the side-passages or the ceiling. 
 
Space Shadow was the pack-in game for the Bandai Hyper Shot, a sub-machine gun shaped Light Gun for the Famicom. Despite the fact that Light Gun games tended to do far better in the US, neither the Hyper Shot nor this game were ever released outside of Japan.
