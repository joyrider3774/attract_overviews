Parody World: Monster Party is the Japanese release of Monster Party, and was originally intended to be much darker and more morbid than the relatively light-hearted version that was ultimately released to American gamers. No version of the game was ever released in Japan. The unreleased Japanese Famicom version was leaked online in 2014.
