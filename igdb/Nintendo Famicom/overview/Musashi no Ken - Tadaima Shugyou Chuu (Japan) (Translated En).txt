Musashi no Ken - Tadaima Shugyō Chū (六三四の剣 ただいま修行中 lit. "Sword of Musashi - Now in the Middle of Training"?) is a 1986 video game software developed and published by Taito exclusively in Japan. It is based on a Japanese sports manga series written and illustrated by Motoka Murakami that focuses on kendo, simply titled Musashi no Ken. The gameplay and design in the one-on-one fighting parts resemble Taito's other fighting game, Great Swordsman, especially its kendo mode. 
 
The game's plot is about the son of two Kendo champions named Musashi. He strives to become as great at Kendo as his parents. The entire story centers around the world of Kendo and its up and coming competitors. The anime is broken up in to two parts. The first part follows Musashi's early years in grade school while the second part follows his high school years. In the first episode, Musashi befriends an Akita puppy who is by his side throughout the series.
