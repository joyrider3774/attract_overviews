To our amazement, Kunio entered the Downtown Quiz and won. Thanks to him, we got a journey to the United States for 15 days as a victory prize. First thing first, Kunio went to see "Johnny" at the Oklahoma high school that he had befriended while in an exchange program. Along for the trip was also Riki, and thanks to him, he entered us into a street basket tournament. Lead us to victory even overseas, Kunio!
