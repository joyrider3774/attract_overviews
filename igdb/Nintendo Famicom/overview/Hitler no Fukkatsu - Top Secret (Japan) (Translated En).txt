The Nazis are back - they have survived the war and, led by their supreme leader Weizmann, they have now come up with the most evil and horrific plan in history! Hitler, the man who the allies thought was dead, has been revived and his fractions of hell are about to take over the world once again. The allies decide to send one of their best men, Super Joe, to counter the threat - but he is soon captured and Radd Spencer is dispatched to rescue him and complete the primary mission.
