Ikari no Megaton Punch is based on the movie King Kong Lives (called King Kong 2 in Japan). The player takes control of King Kong in a quest to rescue Lady Kong from evil forces. This is an action game where the protagonist must travel to several different worlds in order to defeat bosses and earn keys that are needed to save Lady Kong from her imprisonment. King Kong's main attacks are either punching, hopping on, or throwing boulders at all his various enemies.
