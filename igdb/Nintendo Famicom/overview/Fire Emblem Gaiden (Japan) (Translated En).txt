The Continent of Valencia is split into two territories. To the north is the Kingdom of Rigel, home to followers of the Dark God Doma. To the south is the Kingdom of Sofia, where the Earth Goddess Mila is worshipped. When Rigel invades Sofia, two heroes, Arum and Cellica, raise an army to topple Rigel and the Dark God that is backing the conflict.
