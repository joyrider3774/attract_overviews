Route-16 Turbo is an updated version of an older arcade game entitled Route 16, developed jointly by Tehkan (later Tecmo) and Sunsoft (in a manner similar to the way Namco's Warpman is an updated version of Warp & Warp.) Route-16 Turbo takes the concept established in Route 16, and updates the quality of the graphics, but keeps the goal of the game the same. The game play is a near perfect combination of Rally-X and Venture. The player drives a car through several zoomed in blocks collecting bags of money and other items, and travels between blocks along a zoomed out view of the world.
