The Triathron allows players to compete in the three consecutive events of the triathlon: Swimming, Cycling and Running. In each stage of the race, the player must mash the B button, similar to Track & Field, in order to reach the end of each course before their opponents. After winning a triathlon, the player can invest some points into their chosen competitor's stats and move onto the next.
