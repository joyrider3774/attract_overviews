In the distant future of 14672 A.D., the first year of the Demon Age, the demon lord Ryoukotsuki escaped from hell and plotted to conquer the surface world ruled by the three Getsu brothers. The Getsu brothers fought against Ryoukotsuki, each wielding one of the three spiritual Pulse Blades that have been passed within the clan for generations. However, the brothers were ultimately defeated by the demon and only Fuuma, the youngest of the three, survived. Vowing to avenge his slain brothers, FÅ«ma ventures into Kyouki-tou to recover the three stolen Pulse Blades and summon the spirits of his brothers to defeat Ryoukotsuki.
