Kero Kero Keroppi no Daibouken (けろけろけろっぴ の大冒険 Keroppi's Big Adventure?) is based on the popular Sanrio character Keroppi. Released on the Nintendo Family Computer console in Japan in 1991. 
 
Big Adventure is a children's puzzle game where Keroppi must rescue his girlfriend Keroleen who is locked up in a castle. To do so, he must solve the action based puzzles in seven differently themed worlds with four different types of stages (the surface of the maze, flying a plane, a Reversi-like level, and through a field of lava). All the items in the game are pre-determined; there is a need to memorize the pattern for each playthrough so that a player may advance through the levels more quickly once they have achieved a degree of expertise in the game.
