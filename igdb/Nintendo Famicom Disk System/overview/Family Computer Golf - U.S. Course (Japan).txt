Family Computer Golf: U.S. Course is a Japan-exclusive golf starring Mario and Luigi. It is similar in gameplay to the earlier Golf and the later NES Open Tournament Golf. The courses in the game are based on real-life courses in the United States of America. It is also a companion title to Family Computer Golf: Japan Course, a similar game released a few months earlier, which had courses based on real-life courses in Japan.
