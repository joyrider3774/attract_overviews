City Connection (シティコネクション Shiti Konekushon) is a video game developed and published in 1985 by Jaleco for the arcade in Japan and published by Kitcorp as Cruisin' outside of Japan. 
 
The game supports up to two players (playing alternatively). It's a platform game in which the player controls a car that can never be stopped. The car normally moves at the same speed, although the player can push in the direction the car is moving to make it drive slightly faster. It can only 180° handbrake turn or jump (normal jump or high jump). The object of the game is to drive through a series of cities and paint every part of the roads in each city as proof of the player's visit to that city. City Connection was remarkable for its time in that each location had its own background and music which was a variation on the main theme of the game. There are twelve locations: Manhattan, the Grand Canyon, Easter Island, Paris, Neuschwanstein Castle, London, Sydney, Egyptian temples, and cities in India, Holland, China and Japan.
