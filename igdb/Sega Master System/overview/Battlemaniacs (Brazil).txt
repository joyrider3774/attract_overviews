When Machiko Tashoku, the daughter of the Pscane Corporation's head honcho, is abducted by the Pigs of the Apocalypse and forced indignantly into the Gamescape, Zitz leaps into the action fists-a flain! 
 
But Even for a Battletoad there's too much pork to pummel - and after a beastly bashing, he jains Machiko as the Parkers' prisoner! 
 
Rash and Pimple are soon to soar on the scene - an' with Rash lookin' lean an' green and Pimple actin' mean, it's obvious that a rescue's about to begin! 
 
Only it ain't gonna be seay, 'cuz the pigs have taken them to the dingy Dark Tower, home of the sinister Silas Volkmire and his equally evil partner, the deadly Dark Queen! Their malevolent minds have found a way to leak their computerized world into ours, with the fiendish intention of creating a worldwide Gamescape over which they would rule!
