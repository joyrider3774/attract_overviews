Buggy Run is a game that lets players race dune buggies in a championship over 15 possible tracks (plus 4 in 2 player mode) each winning money that can be used for dune buggy upgrades. There are 4 different modes that can be played in single player mode that includes Race, Vs Com, Freerun, and Battle. 
 
In the main mode Race the player is given $20,000 starting cash that can be used to upgrade the buggy. The upgradable features of the buggy are Tyres (grip), Engine (speed), Suspension (limits bounce), Steering (cornering), Transmission (performance). All the upgrades cost $10,000 for level 2, $30,000 for level 3, and $50,000 for level 4 however the player doesnâ€™t need to get them in order. There are also special upgrades to buy that includes $5000 for a mine (drops behind and if another car hits then it is blown up until reset), $5000 for Nitoro (gives the players car a short speed boost), and $10,000 for extra capacity of special items (starts with 2 slots to a max of 6). Special Items must be used in the order they're placed in the slots.
