As young Alex, your job is to go through an obstacle course and get to the main exit without other competitors trying to push you off your bike. You start out in Blackwood Forest, but depending on which scene you're in, you can travel to Cactus Desert, South Seas, Pyramid River, or Alex's home, Radaxian.
