Wonder Boy (ワンダーボーイ Wandā Bōi?) is a 1986 platformer video game published by Sega and developed by Escape (now known as Westone Bit Entertainment). 
 
Originally designed for arcades, it was later ported to the SG-1000, Sega Mark III/Master System and Game Gear video game consoles by Sega, and to the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers by Activision. The game is also known as Super Wonder Boy (スーパーワンダーボーイ Sūpā Wandā Bōi?) for its Sega Mark III release in Japan and Revenge of Drancon for its Game Gear release in North America. 
 
It was the first in the long-running Wonder Boy series of games and was followed up by five sequels, Wonder Boy in Monster Land, Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair, Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap, Wonder Boy in Monster World and Monster World IV. It was also the basis for the Adventure Island series.
