Night falls at the Smurf Village. Inquisitive Smurf brings Smurfette along to Papa Smurf's laboratory to see the Magic Crystal that allows them to travel to anywhere in the world, but suddenly Smurfette breaks it, and they are gone! Now they must face the challenges in all continents in order to retrieve all shards of the Crystal and return home. (In the Master System and the portable versions of this game, there is also the additional task of cleaning the various regions of the world that the two Smurfs visit of its pollution.)
