It is 1942 and you are in Germany. The world is at war, you have been captured and placed in a high security PoW camp. It is your duty to escape. Escaping will not be easy – it will take careful planning and much patience. In the camp, you are closely guarded, whilst you follow the daily routine. You will need to slip away unnoticed to reconnoitre the situation or to collect tools and materials necessary for your chosen escape route. There will be many avenues of escape, some may be difficult to discover – they will certainly all be dangerous – perhaps impossible – each one requiring different skills or equipment.
