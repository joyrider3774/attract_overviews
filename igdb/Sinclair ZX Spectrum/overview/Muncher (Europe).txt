Originally a generic Rampage clone, Beam Software struck a deal with confectionary giant Leaf UK to incorporate their Chewits mascot known as 'The Muncher' into the game.
While the mascot's promotional images and brand name were used, the game's giant monster bares little if any resemblance. It served more as a marketing strategy than an essential part of the game.
