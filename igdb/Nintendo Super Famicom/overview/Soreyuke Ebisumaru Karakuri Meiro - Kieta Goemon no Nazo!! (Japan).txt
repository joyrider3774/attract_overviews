A spin-off game of Ganbare Goemon series. 
 
Soreyuke Ebisumaru - translated as "Go Forth Ebisumaru! The Trick Labyrinth - The Mystery of Goemon's Disappearance!!", is a pretty lousy puzzle game starring the titular fat ninja. Viewed from an overhead angled perspective, you are given a small level and must guide Ebisumaru to the end.
