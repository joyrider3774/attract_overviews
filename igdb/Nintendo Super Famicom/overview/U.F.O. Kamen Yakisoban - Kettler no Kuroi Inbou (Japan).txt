UFO Kamen Yakisoban: Kettler no Kuroi Inbou ("UFO Kamen Yakisoban: Kettler's Black Conspiracy") is a brawler featuring UFO Kamen Yakisoban, a character designed to market Nissin's Yakisoba UFO brand of instant yakisoba circa 1993-1995. It understandably features a variety of foodstuffs. 
 
In the game, Yakisoban's bride-to-be Mayumi has been kidnapped by the villainous Kettler who wishes to marry her himself (and of course to destroy the concept of delicious Nissin Brand Â© instant Yakisoba!). Yakisoban is obviously a bit dense, as he's standing at the altar and doesn't even realize Mayumi is not there until part-way through the ceremony.
