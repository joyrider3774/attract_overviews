The Japanese animation "Armored Trooper Votoms", released in 1983, was 
the brainchild of N.Shioyama (Ronin Warriors) and R. Takahashi 
(Gasaraki). Together they created one of the most beloved (in Japan) 
shows in the history of Japanese Animation. The series was later 
released (1996) in the US by Central Park Media. The series spanned 19 
videocassettes, and quickly developed a small, but devoted fan 
following. Its 80's style animation turned off a lot of would-be fans, 
but those willing to endure the animation were rewarded with one of the 
best storylines (and also some really cool mecha designs) available in 
the genre. The series was so popular in Japan that games, toys, and 
models are to this day being made. Armored Trooper Votoms: The Battling 
Road is, the first Votoms game created, and is an 
incredible game. Utilizing the DSP chip (A chip implemented into no 
more than 15 Super Nintendo/Famicom cartridges) to create a Pseudo-3D 
environment, this game looks absolutely wonderful for its time. Since 
its release there has been 5 Votoms Playstation games released
