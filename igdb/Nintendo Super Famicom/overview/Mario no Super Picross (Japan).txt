Mario's Super Picross is the first sequel to the Game Boy game, Mario's Picross, and can be played on the Super Famicom. After the commercial failure of Mario's Picross in the West, this sequel was released only in Japan. The game plays much the same way as the first, except Wario appears in it and presents his own set of special rules, which also return in the sequel. Other features includes game-saves, hints and tutorials.
