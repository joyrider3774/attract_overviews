Mario & Wario is a puzzle game that is compatible with the SNES Mouse. The player chooses Princess Peach, Mario or Yoshi, and Wario proceeds to drop a bucket on their head (the object changes in later levels). The player controls Wanda the fairy to guide the now-blinded character through an obstacle course, to reach Luigi waiting at the end.
