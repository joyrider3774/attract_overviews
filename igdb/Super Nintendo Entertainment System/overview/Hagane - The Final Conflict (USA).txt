Only one man alone stands to save the world from the KOMA-clan and their plan to destroy the world. His name was "HAGANE". The lone survivor of the FUMA-clan, which was massacred by the KOMA-clan. Brought back from the fringe of death and given a cyborg body, "HAGANE" swears against the KOMA-clan. 
 
Hagane: The Final Conflict is considered a lost SNES gem and is highly sought after, copies for the game have gone as high as $1700.
