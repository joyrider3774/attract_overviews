In this game you wander around the world map. visiting towns and dungeons, and fighting monsters in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, much like in Dragon Quest games. You'll have two parties at your disposal, and will be able to switch between them at any time. One party is the Aquitallion, the "main" one, and the only one which can access plot-progressing areas. The other parties can be used for visiting dungeons and retrieving valuable items. At a certain point in the game, you'll also be able to build and to manage your own town.
