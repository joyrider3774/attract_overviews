The Miracle Piano Teaching System is an educational program from Software Toolworks that teaches users how to play the piano through a keyboard peripheral which was included in the package. Users simply followed the on-screen instructions to learn how to play the piano, tapping keys indicated by the screen. Eventually, the user would learn to recognize the various notes and learn the musical notation, and could progress to playing the music without the use of indicators.
