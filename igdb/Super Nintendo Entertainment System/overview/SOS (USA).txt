In this game, the player controls one of several different playable characters onboard a passenger liner in the early 20th century when it hits a storm and capsizes. The player character must navigate the shifting ship's destroyed corridors and rescue and lead to safety as many passengers as possible, all while the ship gradually fills with water.
