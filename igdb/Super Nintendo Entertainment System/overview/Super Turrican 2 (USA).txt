Twice the Firepower, Twice the burn. 
 
If you haven’t played Super Turrican, chances are you won’t last past the intro sequence here... As an intergalactic hero-wannabe commissioned to crush a venomous mutant armada, you are thrust into a chaotic world even more violent than the original. This time there are more enemies to torch (and be torched by)-including the most heinous level bosses on 16-bit-and enough Mode7 graphic levels to make you wish mommy were there to hold your hand. But she’ll be busy cleaning up your charred carcass. 
 
Super Turrican 2. Feel the burn.
