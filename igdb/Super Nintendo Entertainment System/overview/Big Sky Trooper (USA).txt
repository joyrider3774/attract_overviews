On day an alien race of slugs is out patrolling space, when they encounter the Lucasarts logo. The logo, as we all know looks like a statue of a person with his hands extending towards the sky. Seeing this logo, the slugs determine that ours is a race made up of BONES and of ADVERTISING, two things the slugs simply hate. So they attack.
