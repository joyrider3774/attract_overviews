Super Mario All-Stars is a compilation of remasters for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It enhances Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2, Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels with an added on-cartridge save feature, updated graphics and sound, and an additional "battle game" for Super Mario Bros. 3. It is also the first time that the original Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 was released for the western public.
