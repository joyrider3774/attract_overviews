Bugs Bunny Rabbit Rampage is loosely based on the 1950 Looney Toons short of the same name. The game takes the player through several varying levels to face a plethora enemies, all inspired by the cartoon. The side scrolling action gives the player several different ways to dispose of threats including Kicks, dynamite, and throwing pies to the face. The game does its best to capture the same humor, atmosphere, and sounds from the series and getting the most out of its license.
