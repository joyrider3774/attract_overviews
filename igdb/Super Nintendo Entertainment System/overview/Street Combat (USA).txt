KNOCK-OUT ACTION FOR 2 PLAYERS AT ONCE! 
 
Your Mission...Seek out and destroy a group of ruthless villains who'll stop at nothing to wipe you off the map. Each brutal renegade is a wizard at martial arts and trick moves. You must battle six deadly foes until you confront your greatest challenge-their master, the diabolical C.J. 
 
Punch, leap, somersault and kick your way over skyscraper beams, through the jungle, gritty back alleys, a wrestling ring, the top of a truck, and more. You've never punched-up so much pure action and exciting game play.
