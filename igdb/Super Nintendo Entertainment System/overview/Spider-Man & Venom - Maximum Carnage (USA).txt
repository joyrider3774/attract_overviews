Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage is a side-scrolling beat 'em up game for the Super NES and Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, developed by Software Creations and published by Acclaim Entertainment and it's subsidiary LJN in 1994. The game, based on a sprawling comic book story arc of the same name, features numerous heroes, including Spider-Man, Venom, and their allies from the Marvel Comics fictional universe like Captain America, Black Cat, Iron Fist, Cloak and Dagger, Deathlok, Morbius and Firestar, all teaming up to battle an onslaught of villains led by Carnage, including Shriek, Doppelganger, Demogoblin and Carrion. 
 
Both the Genesis/Mega Drive and Super NES versions come in a red cartridge. They were later released in the normal cartridge colors (black for Genesis, gray for Super NES). 
 
The game was followed up by a sequel called Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety. 
 
Universal Studios Orlando used Maximum Carnage as the theme for a haunted house at Halloween Horror Nights in 2002.
