Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars is a role playing video game designed by Square and released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was the first Mario role-playing game with an action-command battle system. The game plays much like a traditional RPG: Mario and the members of his party gain experience points by defeating enemies. These experience points can increase the team's maximum number of hit points and flower points (magic points). The battles are also turn-based, but this time there are timed attacks and defenses.
