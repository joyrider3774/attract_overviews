The Golden Brett returns to the SNES in the improved and updated BRETT HULL HOCKEY ’95. The second game in this series also features a full NHLPA license, so you’re sure to find your favorite players ready to hit the ice. Use every little trick in the book to get the job done: one-timers, fake shots, drop passes, and even dekes. 
 
There are several gameplay options to satisfy any hockey fan: Full Season, Half Season, Playoffs, All-Star Game, and Exhibition. You make all the decisions in the course of a game, whether it’s shuffling your lines, pulling the goalie, or calling the offensive strategy. Choose wisely, because each option could mean the difference between glorious victory and bitter defeat. And with the stellar play-by-play of Al Michaels, you’ll forget that you’re not just watching a game on TV, you’re playing one!
