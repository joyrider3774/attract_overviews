"The game is essentially an upgrade from Titus Interactive's previous entry in the Crazy Cars franchise, Crazy Cars III. It adds a two player mode and a few more options, the game's most notable feature is its Jazz Fusion soundtrack." 
A very cool feature of this game is that your car is damaged in every beat you suffer, and so that it goes back to normal state only by paying a little money later to repair it. 
Lamborghini: American Challenge is quite difficult and very time consuming, which generates a good competition. Thankfully you will always have the password on the screen to write down and continue later.
