The first of the NBA Live video games series. The cover featured an action shot of the 1994 NBA Finals. It introduced many elements of that would become standard in the series, including the isometric on-court perspective, the "T-meter" for shooting free throws and the turbo button used to give players a temporary burst of speed. The game was re-released with NBA Live 06 as part of the EA Retro Series.
