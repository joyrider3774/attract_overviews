Smash TV is a 1990 arcade game created by Eugene Jarvis and Mark Turmell for Williams.[1] It is a dual-stick shooter in the same vein as its predecessor, Robotron: 2084 (also produced by Jarvis). As in the previous game, players battle waves of enemies by using guns. The plot of Smash TV revolves around a futuristic game show in which players compete for various prizes as well as their lives.

Home versions were developed for various platforms. Some of the home versions were called Super Smash TV
