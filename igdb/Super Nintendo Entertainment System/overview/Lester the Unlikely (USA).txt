One day Lester was walking through Seaport City's loading docks reading the new issue of his favorite comic, "Super Duper Hero Squad." Feeling a little tired from playing video games late the night before, he looked around for a comfortable place to finish his comic. 
 
Just before reaching the beach Lester passed out from sheer exhaustion. Now, his real adventure begins... 
It is up to you to help Lester get back home.
