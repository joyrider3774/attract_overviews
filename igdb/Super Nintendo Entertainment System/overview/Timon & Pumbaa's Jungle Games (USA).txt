Timon and Pumbaa's Jungle Games consists of five mini-games featuring Timon and Pumbaa, as well as other jungle animals from The Lion King. The games are Jungle Pinball (a pinball game where the board is filled with animals instead of bumpers), Burper (a shooter type game, using Pumbaa to belch gas), Hippo Hop (concept similar to Frogger), Bug Drop (based on Puyo Puyo), and Slingshooter (a slingshot game) accessible directly from the menu. The mini-games are endless where players try to top their high scores.
