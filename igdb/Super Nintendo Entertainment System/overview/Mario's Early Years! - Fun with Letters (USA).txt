Mario's Early Years: Fun With Letters is a collection of letter-related activities for kids ages 3 to 6. Playing with either Mario or Princess Toadstool, you select from 10 different activity worlds each filled with different activities that range from letter recognition to sentence fill-in, letter-sound recognition, vowel recognition, etc. Each activity can be played in either Discovery mode, where you are free to do what you wish, or in Learning mode, where Luigi guides you through the activities.
