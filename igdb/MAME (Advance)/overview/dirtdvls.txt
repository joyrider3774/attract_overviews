Get behind the wheel of one of five super cars and experience the feel and strategy or real dirt racing. Hold on tight as you slide your super-charged off-road vehicle through unbelievably sharp turns, bottom-out in huge potholes, fly through dual level intersections, navigate through watery swamps, and attempt driving at night with only your headlights to guide you. A rear view mirror and on-board radar screen help you keep track of your competition, as you race for glory, on one of the 3 heart pounding courses. All this, while smashing into your opponents car(s) and collection valuable points, as you pass all the checkpoints in the allotted time.
