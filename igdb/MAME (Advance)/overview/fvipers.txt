Electric fences. Barb wire cages. No-mercy skate punks. Axe-wielding rockers. Rollerbladers who take the term seriously... Fighting Vipers is street fighting in its rawest form. Furious, wall-to-wall combat brought to life with a visual intensity and relentless game play so superior, so brutal beyond comparison, nothing can prepare you for what you've got coming. NOTHING!
