Nostradamus is a vertically scrolling arcade shoot 'em up released by Face in 1993. 
 
Players control either Dalas (player one) or Joanna (player two) to shoot down many different enemies and then defeat the level boss to advance through the game's nine stages. 
 
According to one of Nostradamus' supposed prophecies, in July 1999, a great leader would come from the sky to rebirth an old ruler over a lost province on Earth. In the game's story, this prediction comes true in the form of an alien invasion. Originating from Saturn, the alien invasion force quickly attacks many locations on Earth in preparation for an even bigger assault and possible complete global domination. Efforts are put into the design of advanced space fighters and mecha along with the best fighter pilots - in this case, pilots Dalas and Joanna - to combat the Saturnites and dispel any further doom prophecies from materializing on Earth.
