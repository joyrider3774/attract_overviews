The cutest bravest Robokid is here!

The Atomic Robokid has just graduated from the Universal University of Space Combat and is on his first mission- to travel deep into enemy territory and destroy everything that gets in his way.

Trundle through subterranean passageways sprinkled with metal and bones, black and rubbery blobs, floating space mines and fighter satellites. Jet through mazes of terrifying terrain and get caught in a cube with a horrific hybrid!

This kid will go where no man dares to go. Are you brave enough to go with him?
