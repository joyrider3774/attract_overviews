If planets form, you must destroy orbiting moons before you can destroy the planet. The planet will become a Mad Planet when all the moons that orbit that planet are destroyed. Once it has become mad, you will be hunted and the longer you let the planet hunt you, the faster it moves. Bonus screens are all spacemen with the comet killing you as the end to the bonus round.
