As opposed to the more realistic hockey gameplay seen in Electronic Arts' NHL series, the game featured a more unrealistic arcade-style of gameplay, featuring moves such as "power saves", which caused the goaltender to briefly transform into a brick wall, "power shots", which would set the net on fire or knock the goalie into the net, and "power checks", which would send an ambulance across the top of the screen. It featured high-scoring games and over-the-top fights. There was also a simulation mode for those looking for more realistic gameplay. The game allowed the creation of profiles and would keep track of important individual and team stats, including goals, assists, and wins, among others.
