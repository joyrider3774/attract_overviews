Area 51: Site 4 is a light gun arcade game developed by Atari Games in 1998. It is a sequel to the original Area 51, picking up where that game left off. Though the graphics have been improved, they rely on the same FMV streaming technology as the original, and the gameplay remains largely the same as the original game.
