Blandia (ブランディア Burandia?) is a 1992 one-on-one, weapon-based fighting arcade game developed and published by Allumer. It is the sequel to the 1986 arcade game, Gladiator. Along with Strata's Time Killers, Blandia is one of the earliest weapon-based fighting games modeled after its competitor Capcom's 1991 arcade hit Street Fighter II, but later became overshadowed by the success of SNK's 1993 weapon-based fighting game, Samurai Shodown.
