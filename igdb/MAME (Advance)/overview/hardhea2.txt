Hard Head 2 is a much more reasonably assembled platformer than its predecessor, which almost makes it more boring. Luckily, the visual design is still crazy as hell. A damsel in distress waits to be rescued, here it is a hippy chick that got captured by the devil while dancing with Hard Head. In between levels, the devil joyfully chews on her, while the hero runs around in panic, mumbling stuff in hilarious Konglish.
