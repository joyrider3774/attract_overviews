The game takes place during the early 1950s in the United States, where an underground tournament known as the "Violence Fight" had become very popular among the criminal underworld and the public at large; criminals, especially mobsters, along with other public nuisances and upstanding citizens are allured by its stakes and thrill. The contestants, drawn from all across the country, compete for large sums of money and the title of "No. 1 Quarreler." As the game begins, the tournament even attracts a young fighter named Bad Blue (or "Bat Blue") from Los Angeles who competes for the title of No. 1 Quarreler and aspires to share a small fortune with his manager, "Blinks."
