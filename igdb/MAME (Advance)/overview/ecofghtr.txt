Eco Fighters, known in Japan as Ultimate Ecology (アルティメット エコロジー?), is an arcade game released by Capcom on the CPS-2 arcade system board on December 1993. The game is a horizontal shooter, where the player controls a ship with a rotating gun. As suggested by both its titles, the game has an "eco-friendly" theme. It was also developed by the same team from two Mega Man arcade titles, The Power Battles and The Power Fighters.
