The game play consists of moving robot1984 over all of the red tiles while avoiding objects flying at you from the back of the screen. Eliminating the red tiles diminishes the shield at the back of the playfield which prevents you from flying to the next level. To get to all the red tiles, players sometimes need to leap across empty space which creates a permanent bridge between the two points. Leaps across empty space have to be timed so that the "eye" of Big Brother in the back of the playfield, which randomly opens and closes, does not see robot1984 and destroy him.
