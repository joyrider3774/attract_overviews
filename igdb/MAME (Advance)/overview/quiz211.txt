The far off land of Capconia lived in peace and prosperity for years thanks in part to the Knowledge Tree, a tree in which the holder of the tree's seeds are granted infinite knowledge of the world around them. However, an evil being known as Gordian has taken a seed of the tree and has planted a Knowledge Tree of his own. Gordian has given some of the seeds to some of the dragons in the land and now, which unfortunate soul who cannot answer any of the dragon's questions correctly will be eaten by them. The King then decides to send out four brave warriors entrusted with the knowledge of the land out to stop Gordian and end his tyranny once and for all.
