Guide a jungle man through multiple dangers to rescue the heroine in this 1982 Taito arcade game. One of the first side-scrolling platformers, it was the first game with a ducking mechanic. Game graphics and name were changed to "Jungle Hunt" after the Burroughs estate sued Taito for infringing upon "Tarzan" copyrights.
