Gaia Crusaders' story involves the world being destroyed by demons in the year 20XX. Chosen warriors, the Gaia Crusaders, are sent in by an ancient spirit to destroy the demons and rebuild the world. There is a lot of post apocalyptic imagery including ruined skyscrapers, vast desert wastelands and a ruined Statue of Liberty possibly inspired by Escape From New York or maybe Planet of The Apes. Acquiring seven pieces of The Demon's Tear can restore the world.
