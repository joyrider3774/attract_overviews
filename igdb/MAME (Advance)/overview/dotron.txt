In 1983 Bally midway released the follow up to the original Tron game titled Discs of Tron. In Discs of Tron the game recreates the disc fighting sequence of the movie where you progress through different platforms in a disc battle against the evil enemy Sark. Once again players utilize an 8-way joystick for moving with one button for firing and a rotary dial for controlling the direction of the fire.
