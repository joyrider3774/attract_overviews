Crypt Killer (known as Henry Explorers in Japan) is an arcade video game produced by Konami. It was then released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation home consoles. The game was also released in Japan for the PC. The Saturn version made use of Sega's virtua gun which was developed for the Virtua Cop series of games. It was also compatible with the many lightguns produced for the PlayStation, namely the Konami Justifier. Scenery visuals and characters were all in 3D, while most of the enemies were in "flat" 2D sprites. Despite its horror theme the game doesn't take the theme seriously at all, relying on extensive gameplay instead due to its difficulty.
