Exit is a action/puzzle game, first released in Japan and later in other parts of the world. The basic premise is to lead the main character Mr. ESC, an escapologist, out of hospitals, underground facilities, offices and other buildings within the given time limit. Along the way, the player will be hindered by obstacles such as fires, earthquakes, floods, or even meteor showers. Sometimes the player must also help trapped individuals escape, which will take quick thinking and planning ahead to exit the building successfully.
