The first Rengoku was a surprise hit for many PSP® gamers. Featuring a compelling story about a cyborg yearning to escape its life of never ending battle, Rengoku provided a new and exciting world to battle through on the PSP®. 
 
Now gamers will return to the world of Rengoku as they battle their way through the towering structure of Purgatory and the Seven Deadly Sins! Rengoku 2 builds upon the first game with improved level design for more strategy, smoother control, exciting new fighting mechanics that allow for attack combos, and deeper customization. With network support for up to four players via AD HOC, more levels, an explosive soundtrack by Hong Kong composer, Chan Kwong Wing, and character designs by legendary manga artist, Jun Suemi, Rengoku 2 is a deep and more challenging action experience.
