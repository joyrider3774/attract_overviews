MediEvil: Resurrection is a 2005 action-adventure game for the PlayStation Portable and is the third installment in the MediEvil video-game series. It is a reimagining of the first installment in the series, MediEvil, with many alterations to the original structure and content, such as the addition of the "Anubis Stone" sub-plot which never appeared in the original. Many things such as level design and characters were changed drastically, and some levels from the original were removed altogether. New levels and characters were introduced, the cutscenes are completely original, and the game was given a much more comical, cartoon-like style as opposed to the Gothic horror-comedy of the original. The soundtrack is completely orchestrated, and half of the themes from the original were removed while new themes were created to fit with the new levels. Unlike the original, there is no alternate ending; Dan still goes to the Hall of Heroes regardless of whether he collects all of the chalices. The game also features a variety of voice talent, including Tom Baker as the narrator and the Grim Reaper.
