OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast features 15 unique cars, the most ever seen in any OutRun game. In addition to the ten cars from OutRun 2 SP, new models include the 550 Barchetta, F355 Spider, Superamerica, 328 GTS, and the Ferrari F430. Some models cannot be unlocked on the PlayStation Portable or PlayStation 2 without the use of the cross-system connectivity feature inherent of the two systems.
