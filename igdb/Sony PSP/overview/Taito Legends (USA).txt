Empire Interactive's Taito Legends series of compilations moved onto handheld in Europe and the US with Taito Legends Power-Up. It is slightly different from Taito's own Taito Memories Pocket, which was only released in Japan. Most notable is the inclusion of Space Invaders and Space Invaders Part 2 and the absence of Rainbow Islands Extra.
