AKA: Guerrilla War 
Guevara is the Japanese version of Guerrilla War and is an overhead run and gun game produced by SNK. Originally released for arcades in 1987 as a coin-operated arcade game, Guerrilla War followed the adventures of two unnamed rebel commandos (Che Guevara and Fidel Castro in the Japanese version) as they raid an unnamed Caribbean Island in order to free it from the rule of an unnamed tyrannical dictator. Along the way the players vanquish hordes of unnamed enemy soldiers while attempting to rescue hostages (with large score deductions for any hostages killed in the crossfire), collecting weapons from troopers and operating tanks.
