Robby Roto is a game that Bally/Midway originally released on its Astrocade-based hardware back in 1981. Other games that ran on this hardware include Gorf, Wizard of Wor, and Professor Pac-Man. The author of Robby Roto is Jamie Fenton, who acquired the rights to the game after it did not do well in the marketplace.
