Batman Forever: The Arcade Game follows the basic plot of the movie Batman Forever. The Riddler and Two-Face have hatched a plot to steal all of the deep, dark secrets of every citizen in Gotham, and the only people who can stop them are Batman and Robin. Take control of one of the Caped Crusaders and punch and kick your way through level after level thugs. Punching and kicking can be tiresome, so feel free to use any of a number of special weapons, including the Batarang. With all of the action, you'll want to strap on a utility belt and take out the villains yourself.
