The game's title is a parody of Super Street Fighter II Turbo (or Super Street Fighter II X in Japan), as there are no other Puzzle Fighter games, and the game includes music and interface elements spoofing the Street Fighter Alpha and Darkstalkers games. It was a response to SEGA's popular Puyo Puyo 2 that has been sweeping Japanese arcade. 
 
A HD-remake version titled Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix, is available for purchase on Microsoft's Xbox Live Arcade and Sony's PlayStation Network.
