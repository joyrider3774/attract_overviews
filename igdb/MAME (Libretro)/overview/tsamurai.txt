Very difficult, highly obscure action fighter in the vein of Kung Fu Master. Here, move left to right through feudal Japan settings (bamboo forests, over bridges, clearings, villages, etc.) while dealing with various enemies that will kill you with one blow! And no continues either! You have overhead strikes or low, rising strikes with your sword to dispatch your enemies with (fortunately they only take one blow as well). You can also duck or jump by pressing down or up on the joystick, respectively.
