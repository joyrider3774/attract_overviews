You are in control of a small plane and are on a rescue mission to free animals that are held captive by a bunch of gorillas. In order to open the cages you have to drop a bomb on the head of the captor to knock him unconscious. After that the player has only a few seconds to collect the animals with his plane until the gorilla regains his consciousness again. After having saved all animals the plane flies on to the next, more difficult level.
