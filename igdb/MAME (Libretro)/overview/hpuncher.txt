Compete against your friends or advance through increasingly harder opponents. Training rounds occur every two to three fights. These training rounds improve one of your three qualities: speed, stamina and power, depending on how well you do while training. 
 
The first player controls Rocky Smith and the the second player controls Gentleman Joe. If the second player wins a two-player game, Gentleman Joe advances to the other opponents in the regular game. 
 
You must defeat the first seven opponents to get to The Black Stallion, the undefeated champion. If you beat this final opponent, you will become the champion.
