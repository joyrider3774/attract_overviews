As with many other ball-and-paddle games (including Namco's own Gee Bee trilogy), the player must take control of a paddle at the bottom of the screen, and move it left and right to deflect a ball into the formation of bricks above it (and if you can keep that ball in play for a preset period of time, it will split into three balls) - certain bricks will also leave powerups when destroyed that will increase the size of the paddle, generate several extra balls in force-field when the initial ball goes into it and even create a line below the paddle that will prevent the balls from going out of play when collected. The seventh, fourteenth, twenty-first and twenty-eighth rounds are also "bonus rounds", where you have to destroy all the bricks in the formation within a preset time limit (unless all your balls go out of play); the thirty-third and final round is also a "boss round", where you are up against "Burida" (who is protected by a metal wall with a vulnerable spot on its top side, but does not attack by spitting lethal mirrors like Doh did to both Vaus in Arkanoid and the human Bubblun & Bobblun in Rainbow Islands). Once you have hit that vulnerable spot on the top side of the wall five times, it will leave Burida vulnerable - and once you have hit him, you will receive 100000 points for every life you have left and the game will be over.
