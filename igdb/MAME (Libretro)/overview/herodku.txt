The game featured (once again) Quasimodo’s attempts to rescue Esmeralda (or, in this case Ezzmerelda). This one is basically a rip-off of Tutankham (though not a blatant one). Interestingly, the original flyers for the game referred to it as Hero in the “Temple” of Doom and featured the image of an Indiana-Jones-like character, complete with fedora (one wonders if they changed the name and character in an effort to avoid litigation).
