Mullah Abba is calling you. He needs you to do battle with Koldan The Conquerer. You must recover the ancient Ink of Ghize; a morphus fluid organism which transforms into real objects for brief moments when applied to humans as tattoos. Be warned!!! Koldan's legions are loyal to the death! They will not allow you to pass without first being vanquished!
