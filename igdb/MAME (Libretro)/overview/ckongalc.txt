Crazy Kong is an arcade game created by Falcon, released in 1981 and is similar to Nintendo's Donkey Kong. Although commonly mistaken as a bootleg version, the game is officially licensed for non-US markets and is based on different hardware. The game retains all of the gameplay elements of Donkey Kong, but has all of the graphics redrawn and re-colorized. Crazy Kong is also known as Congorilla, Crazy Kong Part II, and Monkey Donkey.
