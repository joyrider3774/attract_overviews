This game features eight hockey teams from the Soviet Union, Canada, Sweden, the Czech Republic, the United States, Finland, France, and its home country of Japan; one (or two) player(s) can face four CPU-controlled teams in succession for the Tournament mode, and up to three or four players can face off against each other (two on each side) in the Versus mode. At the start of the game, the players can choose how many players their team has (three or five) - and in both modes, they will have to insert another coin at the end of each period to continue. This was also the first Namco game to feature Greek text; on the continuing screen, one of the players on the losing team says "ODCH" (ΟΔΧ) as the ten-second timer counts down for another coin.
