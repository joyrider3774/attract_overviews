Players control two flying children holding a rope. Pulling the two joysticks outwards, tightens the rope, and throws a third child into the air. The bouncing child can hit balloons, which reveal items when popped. She then falls, and the players must move the angelic children with the rope beneath the falling child to allow her to bounce again.
