Bal Cube is a ball and paddle type arcade game that gives two players control over their own bouncing ball shaped like a cube or "bal cube." Unlike Arkanoid, instead of controlling horizontal movement of a paddle at the bottom of the board, players horizontally control their bal cube destroying blocks in the level and making use of stationary paddles on the floor that temporarily disappear when used. Players can interfere with their opponent by making combos and sending ghost blocks.
