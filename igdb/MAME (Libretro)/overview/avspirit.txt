Avenging Spirit, known in Japan as Phantasm (ファンタズム), is a 1991 2-player platform arcade game developed by C.P. Brain and published by Jaleco. Players attack (or possess) enemies, collect power-ups, and defeat bosses to advance. Players can possess one of four characters with unique abilities at the start of the game, but the library of enemies expands and changes with each level. (Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia, s.v.
