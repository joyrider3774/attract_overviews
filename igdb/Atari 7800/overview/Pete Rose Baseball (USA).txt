From the crack of the bat, make split-second decisions as you choose which fielder makes the play. Throw popular Major League pitches - fast balls, curves, change-ups, screwballs and sinkers. (Spitballs?) Head-to-head action with your friends or against the computer. Complete TV-like coverage, with six camera angles you're always right there where the action is. Play to a packed stadium complete with cheering crowd and organist.
