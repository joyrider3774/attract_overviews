Tank Command is a vertically scrolling action game. You control a tank on a mission to capture the enemy flag as well as earn as many points as possible. To do this, you will need to blast your way through their defenses on three levels of increasing difficulty. Blocking your progress are enemy tanks, pillboxes, missiles, jeeps, infantry, huts, and more, all of which earn you points when destroyed. Your tank is equipped with a limited amount of fuel and ammo, however it can be replenished occasionally by collecting the bonus icons when they appear on the screen. If you can make it past all of the obstacles and capture the flag, then you win the game! 
 
The 7800 is pretty much void of super-rare games like the 2600'?s Tooth Protectors and Chase the Chuckwagon, but don't worry, tracking down Tank Command in a box will cost you a pretty penny. As far as gameplay goes, Tank Command is not going to blow anyone away. Here you have a vertical scroller like Commando or Ikari Warriors minus the charm, quality level design, and reasonable difficulty. There are only three levels in the game, but just like its Froggo cousin Water Ski, the difficulty ramps so severely after the mindless first level that continuing takes strong will. The pink terrain is a bit odd, as well. Tank Command was only released in NTSC format.
