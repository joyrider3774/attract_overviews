It's fourth and long with less than a minute remaining in the game. The winner gets a wild card berth in the playoffs. You're down by a field goal. Your quarterback makes a perfect pass, your receiver is wide open, and then you see the referee's arms fly up signaling the touchdown. You're going to the playoffs.
