You and Grandpa are down on the farm. There are critters, bottles, and varmints everywhere -- in the barn, in the yard, and in the cornfield. Grandpa has given you an Atari light gun to help protect the farm. The moving targets are a challenge. Can you hit them? If not, try the veggies! They're fun to shoot at. 
 
In the barnyard, bottles and cans on the fence provide great practive for warming up the old shootin' iron. But perfect aim alone isn't enough. You'll need speed, too. 
In the cornfield, birds swoop from the sky and rabbits scamper among the stalks, Owls and other pests appear inside a barn. Each scene can only be reached by hitting enough targest in the scene before. Once you zero in on some fancy shooting scores, Gramps offers you a bonus round by tossing target bottles in the air.
