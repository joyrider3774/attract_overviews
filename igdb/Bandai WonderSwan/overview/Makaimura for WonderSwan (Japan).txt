Makaimura for WonderSwan (Japanese: 魔界村?, "Demon World Village for WonderSwan") is a game for the WonderSwan developed by Capcom and published by Bandai in 1999 and is part of the Ghosts 'n Goblins franchise. 
 
Sharing similar gameplay to its predecessors, Makaimura also shares enemies, weapons and backgrounds from the previous three games. Unique features include double paths from the second till the fifth levels, swimming in water and a level which requires the player to rotate the wonderswan by 90 degrees as Arthur climbs and swings down a rope in a vertical shaft. Unlike other games, the player is not required to repeat the game after the penultimate level in order to get the one weapon to defeat the final boss Azrael.
