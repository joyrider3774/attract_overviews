Imagine a hunter, alone in Deep Space. You control his movements. He's armed with a "gas blaster." His prime target is the white Space Hawk. If a Hawk, deadly gas bubbles, comets or amoebas touch the hunter, he tumbles into infinity! There are just three ways to escape: move out fast under backpack rocket power, shoot away the danger, or go into HYPERSPACE! The longer the game goes on, the more exciting it becomes, so... GET THE HAWK!
