Get down and dirty with Stadium Mud Buggies for the Intellivision, where the object is to score points by driving in nine events: Hill Climb, Drag Race, Bog, Tug-O-War, Car Crush, Donuts, Drawbridge, Combo Course and Monster Rally, which consists of all the events in order. You can compete against a friend, a computer driver, or against your own high score. 
 
For each event you can select from one to nine laps (or quarter miles in a couple of the events) and from five difficulty levels. Your buggy is equipped with a gas pedal, a brake pedal, reverse, and a four-speed transmission. Downshifting occurs automatically.
