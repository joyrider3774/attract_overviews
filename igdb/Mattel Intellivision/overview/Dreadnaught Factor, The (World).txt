The scene: Space. The cosmic edge. Never deeper, never darker. 
The Home Team: A Stargate. A squadron of Hyperfighters. A glittering, pulsating sea of unstable energy. (Please--no quick or sudden movements.) 
The Challengers: Dreadnaughts. We're talkin' size LARGE. Behemoths. Invincible. Or so some say. 
You succeed: Universal applause. Life in the fast lane. Early retirement. Endorsements. You name it, it's yours. 
You fail: Not a viable alternative. You want I should draw you a picture? Distinctly unpretty. The Big Zip. Kaput. Finito. Capice?
