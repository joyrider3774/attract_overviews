Chew-Man-Fu has gone too far! His evil curse deprives you, (and everyone else), of your beloved egg rolls and fried rice. To break his spell, roll 4 magic balls through a maze to matching colored squares. Sound easy? Hah! Chew's whole zoo is out to stop you. Prickly porcupines, wily penguins, rowdy apes and more! Use those balls to clobber 'em and smash through the walls. With 5 worlds and 550 wild rounds, the fun never stops.
