The powered-up Zonk gathers his friends to form Team Cool, and they set out to stop King Drool’s plan to conquer the world. Choose from 3 levels of difficulty and 3 types of Friend Modes. Shoot King Drool's cyber robots and avoid their attacks while collecting the Air Bones to unleash a variety of attacks. Enjoy unique moves such as combining with a friend to create an invincible hybrid form or blasting enemies with a charged attack. Air “Zonk” is filled with humor, like its wacky theme song that plays when you post a huge score or when your game is over.
