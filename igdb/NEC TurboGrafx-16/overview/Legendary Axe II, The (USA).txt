The Axe is back ... with twice the force and twice the fury of 1988's classic TurboGrafx-16 videogame. This time it's brother against brother, locked in deadly combat. Your older brother has summoned forces of unspeakable evil to take control of the kingdom. Treachery rules! Your only hope is the legendary royal sword. But will its power be enough to overcome the Cliffs of Chaos? The Skull Dungeon? And the treacherous Crypts of Slime? Only your courage, your fighting skill, and the Legendary Axe can answer that challenge!
