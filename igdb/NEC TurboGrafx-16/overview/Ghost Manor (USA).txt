A platformer in which the player controls Arthur, the neck-bearded hero, in a quest to save his village from an evil force. 
 
With an earth-shattering explosion, horror from another dimension grips your once peaceful town. Gristly creatures prey on the innocent. The dead rise to roam the streets. All resistance falls! But hey, no problem, you have a plan! Find the secret passage to their mansion stronghold and battle past the zombies and ghouls. Now get your axe, because it's way full of demons and ghastly surprises! Ride the awesome Skull Slammer and search for their leader, the hideous Orb gamut. Discover his weakness and be a hero. If you don't, you'll be dust.
