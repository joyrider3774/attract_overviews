In the Aztec empire you were chosen for sacrifice. 
A forthcoming violent death you can only escape when a risky obstacle course face - the "Aztec Challenge". 
But that is no picnic: at the beginning it will be from "all sides" . pelted with spears, while one has to work its almost endless way to the temple 
 
Once there it is not friendly: trapdoors, falling boulders, snakes and spiders waiting for new victims. 
 
it is a moral imperative and a two-player mode - unfortunately alternate the players then only from. 
 
the game features 7 breathtaking levels (plus end bonus), in which a good reactivity is required. The graph corresponds unfortunately only the ordinary 1984, but does not spoil the good game idea. Moreover, good acoustics for the right mood makes. 
 
Ideal: one has reached a higher level, you do not have to start again when all lives are exhausted.
