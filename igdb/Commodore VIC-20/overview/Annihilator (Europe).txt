Your ship is at the bottom of the screen and you control it with the joystick. The aim of the game is to destroy as many aliens as possible before you lose your only ship. On every level a large group of aliens comes down from the top of the screen to the middle of the screen and you have to move left and right to avoid them and fire your ships weapon to destroy them.
