In a world without kings, power is the only law. No leader controls the destiny of this new world. Yet. Can you? Unite each territory by word or by sword or face bitter defeat at the hands of the other PowerMongers.

Encounter a living world. Win the loyalty of farmers, shepherds, merchants, ranchers- even thieves. Hundreds of people with individual homes, jobs, and personalities.

React to changing seasons. Store food for the winter- your soldiers won't take orders on an empty stomach.
