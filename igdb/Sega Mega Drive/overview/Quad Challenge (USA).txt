Saddled on a high-performance all-terrain vehicle, you hear the roar of racing engines and scan the brutal dirt track ahead. The unforgiving clock counts down; THREE... strap helmet, TWO... rev it up, ONE... explode from the gate! Slam into high, and torque up to brain-warping speed! During tight cornering, cut hard, shift low, and fan the brakes. You'll feel huge racing tires claw for traction. Control four-wheel drift or you'll spin out. On straightways, you'll hit rises and go airborne. Throttle down to soften your landing. Challenge a computer-controlled rival, or compete head-to-head against your buddy. Choose from 9 twisting race tracks on practice mode. Choose from 4 vehicles, each with unique horsepower, handling, and acceleration features. Play the Circuit Championship, a 16 track password race to glory!
