The game ditches the alternating two-player method in favor of simultaneous co-op. Another new feature is a password back-up. 
 
Both Mickey and Minnie are identical gameplay-wise, and the costumes they receive don't differ from each other in any aspect except aesthetically. 
 
The costumes include a sweeper, which can suck enemies and turn them into coins, a safari suit that can climb walls and swing from hooks and a cowboy suit that shoots corks and maneuvers by bouncing. The latter two outfits can be upgraded at a shop. 
 
The Genesis version of the game includes a cosmetic change for the stage 5 boss and an extra room in stage 3.
