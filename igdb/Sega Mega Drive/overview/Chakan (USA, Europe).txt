Chankan: The Forever Man was an Action Platformer exclusive to the Sega Megadrive/Genesis.
The game featured an uncommonly dark premise for the time of its release, which saw the home console market flooded with licensed platformers based on family-friendly media.

It is based upon a comic book by Robert A. Kraus and was produced by Ed Annunziata, who met Chakan's creator at a convention and was impressed.
