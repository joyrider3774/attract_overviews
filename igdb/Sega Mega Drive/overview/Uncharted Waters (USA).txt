Uncharted Waters revives a time of romance and adventure; the Age of Exploration. In 1502, ten years after the immortal voyage of Columbus, you assume the role of a young Portuguese captain. Your goal is to attain glory and restore honor to your once noble family name.

This will be no easy task. There are distant shores to seek, pirates to battle, priceless treasures to plunder, and a beautiful princess to rescue!
You can realize the dreams of a 16th century explorer in your own way. Play the part of a merchant and barter for precious treasures. Or, play the part of a ruthless pirate and make others pay the price of your fame. You decide your own fate when you embark upon the high seas.
