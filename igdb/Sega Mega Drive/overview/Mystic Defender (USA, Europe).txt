Mystic Defender is a two-dimensional action video game released for the Sega Genesis system. The players only means of defense in the game is the use of magical spells that the player can acquire during game play (by picking the power up). 
 
Players start with a single shooting ball of energy that can be charged to fire one powerful shot, but players can also acquire a spiritual flame that can be pointed in straight and diagonal directions and when charged can reach good distances and a spherical power that launches ricocheting spheres around the screen that multiply when fully charged. 
 
Aside from these powers, players can also use a screen-clearing power that summons a three-headed dragon that destroys all enemies and fired shots on screen.
