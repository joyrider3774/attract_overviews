Rolo to the Rescue is a side-scrolling platform action game. The player controls Rolo, an elephant who escaped from the circus. Rolo's main task is to find and rescue four other animals - a squirrel, a rabbit, a beaver, and a mole. Once rescued, each of those friends become player-controlled characters with special abilities that can help the player along the way -- the squirrel can climb, the rabbit jumps, the beaver swims, and the mole digs.
