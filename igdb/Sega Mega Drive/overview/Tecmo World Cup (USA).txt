Tecmo World Cup '92 (テクモワールドカップ'９２) is a 1992 port of Tecmo's 1990 NES game Tecmo World Cup Soccer to the Sega Mega Drive by SIMS. The American release, distributed by Atlus, is called simply Tecmo World Cup. 
 
The game is a conventional pseudo-3D soccer game. A and C pass the ball; B kicks. 
 
Sega was also in the process of making a Sega Master System port which would become Tecmo World Cup '93 — a prototype ROM of that with the name Tecmo World Cup '92 circulates.
