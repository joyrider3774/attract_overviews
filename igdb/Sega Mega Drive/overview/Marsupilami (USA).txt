Marsupilami is a character created by Belgian cartoonist "Franquin". Marsupilami is a long tailed made-up character who was stolen from the jungle and performs in a circus. After helping the other animals escape, Marsupilami must make his way back to the country he came from - Palombia.

The aim is to guide his Elephant companion, Bonelli, through the levels, passed obstacles and traps. As he progresses, he gains more abilities by collecting power ups. Each level is timed so each action must be thought about carefully.
