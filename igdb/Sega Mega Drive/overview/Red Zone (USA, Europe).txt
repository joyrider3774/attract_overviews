Red Zone, known as Hardwired during development and Commando Raid when demonstrated at Summer CES 1994, is a Sega Mega Drive game released in 1994 by Zyrinx. 
 
It is noteworthy for achieving sprite rotations, 3D vectors and full motion video; things that were often considered impossible to do on Mega Drive hardware. No additional hardware (such as an extra chip in Virtua Racing is used. The game proudly announces this technical achievement before the title screen. 
 
Zyrinx were previously responsible for Sub-Terrania, and the two games share similar graphics and logos. The soundtrack was again composed by Jesper Kyd.
