Shadow of the Beast is a side-scrolling platform computer game produced by Reflections (Later known as Reflections Interactive) and published by Psygnosis in 1989. The original version was released for the Commodore Amiga but the game has been ported to many other systems. The original Amiga release cost Â£35, an unheard of price for a video game in that era, but it did include a T-shirt in the box bearing a print of the box's artwork.
