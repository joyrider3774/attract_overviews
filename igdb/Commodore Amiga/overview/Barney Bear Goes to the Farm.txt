Join Barney Bear on a fun-filled trip to his grandparent's farm!

Barney Bear Goes To The Farm is a colorful, musical game for children ages 3-8.

Barney Bear must wake up early to help with farm chores such as milking the cow and feeding the chicks. This short interactive story of a day on the farm leads to an evening in the farm house, complete with a warm fire and plenty of time to hear some stories and play some games.

Barney Bear Goes To The Farm includes ten short "I Can Read" stories, educational stories called "The Seed" and "Healthy Bears," a "What Belongs?" game, a mix-up-the parts scarecrow and a complete painting program with a dozen fill-in-the-color pictures.

This is a game full of surprises and discovery that allows even very young children to play without any adult supervision.
