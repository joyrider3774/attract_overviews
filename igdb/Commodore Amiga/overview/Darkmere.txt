Darkmere - The Nightmare's Begun is an action-adventure game developed by Zero Hour Software and published by Core Design Ltd. in 1993. It is Zero Hour's only title to date. Core Design went on to publish a less-well received pseudo-sequel to Darkmere in 1994 called Dragonstone, on Amiga and Amiga CD32.
