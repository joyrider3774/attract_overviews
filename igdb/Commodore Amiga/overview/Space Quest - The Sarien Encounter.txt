Hey, wake up! Roger Wilco's the chief sanitation engineer (a.k.a. Janitor) on the starship Arcada. His mission: to scrub dirty decks... to replace burned-out lightbulbs... to boldly go where no man has swept the floor! 
 
But while he was napping in the broom closet, his starship was hijacked by the Sarien Stormtroopers. Now the top-secret Star Generator's been stolen. And if Roger doesn't get it back, the universe as we know it is toast! 
 
Kaboom! The Two Guys from Andromeda often travel the cosmos under the aliases of Scott Murphy and Mark Crowe. They're best known for their award-winning Space Quest series and their frequent sightings with Elvis.
