Written by Edgar M. Vigdal. Deluxe Galaga is one of the all-time best games for the Amiga - heck one of the best shoot'em-ups EVER. 
 
It's a great little game full of bosses, power-ups, secrets, and even built-in mini-games. 
 
Great game for killing a few minutes... Or... Minutes quickly become hours...
