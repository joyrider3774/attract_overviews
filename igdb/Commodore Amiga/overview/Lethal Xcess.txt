Lethal Xcess is a shoot 'em up game developed by two members of demo crew X-Troll and published by Eclipse Software in 1991 for the Atari ST and Amiga. It is a sequel to 1990's Wings of Death, in which its wizard hero goes into far future to fight the descentants of the evil witch that he has conquered in the first game. Despite having been acclaimed by critics, the game was a commercial failure.
