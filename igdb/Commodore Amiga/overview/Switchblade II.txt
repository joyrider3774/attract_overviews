Switchblade II is a computer action game. It was released for the Amiga and the Atari ST by Gremlin in May 1991, and for the Atari Lynx in 1992. 
 
A sequel to Switchblade, Switchblade II is an action-platformer. The action is viewed from the side. The player guides the protagonist, Hiro, through six levels infested with mechanoid, metal-clad enemies. Weapons include a knife, homing missiles, a laser beam, a flame thrower and shuriken. 
 
Although the game was developed in the UK, its graphics had a distinctly Japanese style, similar to manga.
