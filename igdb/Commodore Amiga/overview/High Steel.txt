This is no time to feel dizzy. As you balance precariously on a narrow steel girder, hundreds of feet above the hard concrete below, a head for heights is a must. There's a skyscraper to be built, and the Splitters, Crawlers, and metal-munching Gremlins are in hot pursuit. You step over the slippery remains of your workmate's lunch, hurl your spanner at a menacing shadow, and curse the day you became a high steel worker. 
 
The sixth floor is complete. The huge crane delivers the next girder, just as a brick smashes into your hard hat. Things might not be so bad if you could just find your sandwiches. 
 
Can you overcome all of the obstacles and dangers confronting you to tower above the city streets below, or will you end up splatting the pavement like raspberry jam? 
 
Almost unheard of! A completely original arcade game that will keep you hooked to your computer for hours upon hours of frantic high altitude addictive fun. 
 
Terrific graphics, sampled sound and a great sense of humor make High Steel one of the best new games in ages.
