Join Barney Bear on his adventure in space! 
 
Barney Bear Goes To Space is a colorful, musical game for children ages 3-8. 
 
Barney Bear and his class are on a trip to Cape Canaveral, Florida to watch the shuttle launch. While touring mission control, Barney Bear falls asleep on a conveyor and finds himself inside the shuttle! This short interactive story takes Barney Bear to the control panel of the shuttle, where there are stories, facts, and games to play. 
 
This subject-oriented educational game uses animation, games and stories to present facts about space in a way that young children will enjoy, while playing without any adult supervision. 
 
Barney Bear includes a history of space travel, a repeat-the-pattern sound game, a tour of the planets, and a complete painting program.
