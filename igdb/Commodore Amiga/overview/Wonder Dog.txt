Cartoon-quality animation brings to life Wonder Dog's narrow escape from the invading Pitbully Space Armada on his home planet of K-9. In Bunny Hop Meadow you'll take of mangy mutts, rascally rabbits and dizzy ducks as your long journey back to free K-9 begins. 
 
Climb in the ring with boxers in Dogsville and wailing alley cats in the Scrapyard-or maybe you'll even find a hidden zone or two...or three.
