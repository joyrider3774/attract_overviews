Ugh! is an arcade/flight game developed by Bones Park Software Artistic and published in 1992 by PlayByte for the Amiga, Commodore 64 and DOS.

The game is a clone of Space Taxi. It features a caveman who, in order to appeal to his beloved future mate, controls a stone-age muscle-powered helicopter, picking up passengers and flying them to the desired location for money. The player must venture through 69 levels, and must evade natural obstacles as well as hostile Dinosaurs and "Birds" (actually pterosaurs). Collisions with obstacles, hard landings and touching obstacles with the helicopter's rotor inflict damage to the helicopter. Also, powering the helicopter exhausts the pilot, which may be recovered by picking up fruits knocked off Tree with Stone. Stone may be also dropped on a hostile monster, knocking it out for a short time.

Ugh! was later distributed as a shareware mainly from Bulletin Board Systems and magazine cover disks.

The Commodore 64 version of the game also features a two player hotseat mode, in which two players compete to finish the level, while the DOS and Amiga versions feature a cooperative simultaneous two player mode.

The game keeps tracks of the player's progress using level codes; the codes for single player levels are Christian Death song titles, the two-player codes are song titles by Current 93.
