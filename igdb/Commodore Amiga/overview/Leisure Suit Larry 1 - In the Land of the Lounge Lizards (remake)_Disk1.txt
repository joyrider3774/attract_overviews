A middle-aged male virgin named Larry Laffer desperately tries to "get lucky" in the fictional American city of Lost Wages. 
 
Your goal in Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is to find and seduce the girl of your dreams. This goal won't come easy, because you only have one night, and unfortunately, you are stuck with Larry's looks. Other problems, such as lack of money, lack of opportunity, and bad breath can complicate things significantly. Your interaction with the game controls the outcome of each situation. 
 
For example, having your character sign on with a major league baseball team or start a successful men's magazine could be beneficial to your ultimate goal. On the other hand, catching a fatal disease or losing all your cash can only impede your progress. A combination of common sense, logical thinking, and downright sheer luck is needed to achieve your goal.
