Get the hell out'a town.

Badlands Pete Coyote is the meanest leanest six gun machine. His quick fire two-handed gun style and steely glare are recognized and feared by desperadoes everywhere.

Take on the roll of Badlands Pete and rescue the Governor's daughters. Battle mountain men, renegade Indians, Mexican banditos, rustlers, and all sorts of crazy characters. Take nothing for granted, the old ladies, squaws and saloon gals may not be the sweet little things you think.

Unique Strip-A-Mation combines smooth scrolling with 3D sprite graphics for greater depth and added reality.
