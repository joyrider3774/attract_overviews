Post-Holocaust: A power crazed entity desires control of earth. They develop an energy beam and intend to bounce it off a custom-built satellite back to earth. All unprotected life will be wiped out.

You select and control up to six diverse hi-tech vehicles at once in a race against time to seek and destroy enemy power lines and eventually knock out their beam generator.

Build up your arsenal by collecting enemy resources to help develop and create your own new weapon systems.

Featuring a sophisticated head-to-head serial link enabling "being-there" realism between two players.

Armour-Geddon: Strategy and simulation synthesized to perfection.
