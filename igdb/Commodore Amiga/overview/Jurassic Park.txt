If it's not Jurassic Park, it's extinct. Treachery has turned John Hammond's dream into a living nightmare.

His plan, to introduce the children of today to the kings of the prehistoric age, has now metamorphosed into a monster which threatens the world. With the electronic defenses out of action and the computerized control systems sabotaged, his deadly creations are now roaming free throughout Jurassic Park.

Dare you face up to the terrifying Tyrannosaurus Rex, the deadly Dilophosaurs and the vicious Velociraptors? Only you, Dr. Grant, have a chance of restoring this island paradise to peace. Are you ready... to play in the park?
