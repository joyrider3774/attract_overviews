Not only Super Stardust did equal its predecessor in every conceivable way, it added more flair, features, gameplay, special effects, colors and animations.

Advertised as “the first true arcade shoot-em-up for home platforms”, the game was a critical and commercial success, receiving rave reviews, and was released on Amiga, Amiga CD32 and, in 1996, also on PC. To this day it’s still considered one of the most technically impressive Amiga and PC games ever made. Players controlled their trusty starship, which they could upgrade with five different weapons, missiles and shields.

Super Stardust 96, the latest incarnation of the game, featured five different worlds (all connected via 3D hyperspace tunnels) and 30 levels chock-full of asteroids, enemies and bosses. A true arcade-quality experience for PC!
