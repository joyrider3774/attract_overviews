First prize is your life!

Suited in limited-protection armor you're the unwilling contestant on The Killing Game Show. In front of a TV audience of millions you must battle your way to the top of 16 Pits of Death infested with hostile artificial life forms specially created by The Killing Game Show's manic scientists to give you a hard time.

But... don't forget the rising fluid or it's 'next contestant time'. Give the viewers their value for money- collect the awesome weapons and tools- if you can.

The Killing Game Show will have you climbing the walls- it's the only way out!
