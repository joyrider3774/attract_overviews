After two hugely successful pinball games, DICE ventured into new territory with the Amiga game Benefactor. In this cutesy puzzle platformer, you play the character Ben E. Factor, who has resigned from the military to become an all-around good guy. Factor’s mission is to save a group of “Merry Men” who have been kidnapped from their home planet and imprisoned over 60 tricky levels. The player has to carefully navigate through the puzzle levels and release the Merry Men in the correct order so they can help rescue the rest of the prisoners.
