The goal is distant, the test arduous. At times it may prove more practical to avoid a threat than to face it. So long as you use your wits and cleave to the Way, your karma will sustain you in this world. Should you fail in correct persistance, dark spirits will carry your spirit away to face the Mirror of Truth, and your failure will come back to mock you forever. Now heed my teachings, that you may gain enlightenment.
