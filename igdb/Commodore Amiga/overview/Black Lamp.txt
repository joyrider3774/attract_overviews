Black Lamp. Capture it... and the hand of a princess. 
 
No joke. Jolly Jack the Jester wants more from his boss (the King) than a few good laughs. He wants his daughter's hand in marriage. The King, of course, thinks Jack is truly jesting. But what the hey. If Jack can rid the Kingdom of a plague of evil beasties, Jack can have her. If he can't, Jack dies. 
 
Black Lamp is wonderful, witty, once-upon-a-time tale that has earned rave reviews for its graphics, sound and superb quality. This medieval melodrama pits the hero, Jolly Jack, against a host of animated animals and characters including skull-dropping buzzards, evil eagles and spitting witches to confront the fire-breathing angry dragon for the enchanted Black Lamp. 
 
Does Jack have something more than a few bad jokes up his sleeve? Is the King's sorcerer the source of surprises? Will Jack and Princess Grizelda live happily ever after? Play Black Lamp and find out!
