Journey from Darkness: Strider Returns, known as Strider II in Europe, is a port of Tiertex's Strider II for the 16-bit Sega Mega Drive/Genesis console, and the most well-known of the Returns ports. Unlike other versions, this port presents several changes when compared to the original game, a result of having been adapted following closely the Mega Drive port of Strider. Despite this, the game is still plagued by shoddy programming and uninspired gameplay, product of the higher-ups being only interested in getting the game "written and out as fast as possible"
