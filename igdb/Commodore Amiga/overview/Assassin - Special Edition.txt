Storyline is fairly simple. The character is an assassin that has been hired to kill the antagonist of the game, "Midan". He is then dropped behind enemy lines and must first disable Midan's power source, and then assassinate him. Assassin: Special Edition is a re-release with some various gameplay elements altered. The assassin is armed with a laser gun.
