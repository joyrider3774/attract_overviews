Z-Out is a 1990 side-scrolling shoot 'em up released for the Amiga and Atari ST by Rainbow Arts. It is the sequel to X-Out. Unlike its predecessor, the game features a co-operative two-player component. While its critical reception was positive—particular praise went to its graphics—many reviewers noted that the game was unoriginal.
