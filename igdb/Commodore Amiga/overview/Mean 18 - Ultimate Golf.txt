This is it! A hush falls over the California countryside as you stand on the eighteenth hole of Pebble Beach. You’re five long feet from the hole and you have a one-stroke lead in the biggest tournament of your life. Your caddy hands you your lucky putter. You line up your shot, and swing. The ball rolls slowly toward the hole. There’s a tense moment as it almost rings the cup. finally, the ball falls in. You retain your title!
