Yo! Here's the deal! I won the Krusty the Clown art contest so my family and I get to go on this really cool Worldwide Treasure Hunt to China, Egypt, the North Pole and Hollywood. And I need you to help to collect Krusty faces and Krusty products if I want to reach my final destination: a guest appearance on the Itchy & Scratchy Show! Any questions? Good. I'm outta here. Your friend, Bart Simpson.
