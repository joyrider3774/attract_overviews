Just as you were about to advance a grade in the school of magic your tutor goes and gets himself kidnapped. You have to rescue him or you'll never graduate.

Battling through eight diverse and dangerous lands, collecting spells and objects along the way, you use your limited magic powers to fight off deadly adversaries in a frought-filled fight to free your tutor.

But it's going to be a tough task on your own: take a friend along to increase your chances and double the fun!
