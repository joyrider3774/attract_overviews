Heimdall is an action-adventure computer game developed by a team called The 8th Day and published by Core Design. 
 
The game is set in the world of Vikings and Norse mythology. Loki steals Odin's sword, Freyr's spear and Thor's hammer, rendering them powerless. They decide to create an infant, the title character (named after the god of the same name), who must bring back the three legendary weapons. 
 
The game sees Heimdall and his crew travelling around an archipelago of islands in three different maps: Utgard, Midgard and Asgard. They travel engaging monsters in combat, interacting with the locals, solving puzzles and avoiding traps, a blend of styles somewhat similar to that found in the Legend of Zelda games. The cartoon-style action is viewed in the isometric perspective.
