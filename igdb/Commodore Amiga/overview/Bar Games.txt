In Bar Games, the player (Or four players) can compete in a single event or a tournament of "Bar Games." 
 
Liar's Dice 
A gambling/poker style dice game, relying heavily on bluffing. 
 
Wet'n'Wild 
The player picks a male or female model, and they walk along a stage. The player controls a character walking above the stage, dropping buckets of water on the model to make their pixelated body parts show through their clothes. 
 
Last Call 
The player is a bartender, and must serve drinks. You must use a power gauge to throw drinks up the bar to customers, before they walk away. 
 
Air Hockey 
Air Hockey. With terrible physics. 
 
Pick-Up Artist 
Probably the most well known of the collection, the player receives a note from a girl, who will be 'waiting at the bar.' The player then must pick a girl, pick random conversation points and try to 'pick her up'. Most of the choices are completely nonsensical, or creepy.
