Jaguar XJ220 is a pseudo-3D racing game released by Core Design for the Commodore Amiga (1992) and Sega Mega-CD (1993). 
 
In Jaguar XJ220 there are 32 tracks all over the world, with varying road conditions and animated weather conditions such as rain and fog in England, snow in Switzerland, and tumbleweed crossing the street in Egypt. You race your Jaguar in a constructor grand prix, with opponents running for Porsche, Ferrari and other famous makers. The player starts in England but must decide which country to race in next, which costs the team various amounts. The player can also choose to repair damage to the car.
