A middle secret research center, designed to carry out shady experiments, is being viciously attacked by its robotic workforce. The mutinous mechanoids are assaulting the scientists that work in the center and releasing the experiments. The whole complex and its entire human staff will be wiped out in hours... if you don't save them.

Controlling Cytron- a sophisticated dual role robot- you must enter the complex, navigate its many enemy-infested regions and rescue the scientists, before the center is totally destroyed.

Using Cytron's unique Divide Device you race against the clock to solve a plethora of puzzles, work with multifaceted weapon technology and fight armies or pernicious enemies in your last-ditch bid to save the oppressed scientists.

Cytron: Double the action! Double the gameplay!
