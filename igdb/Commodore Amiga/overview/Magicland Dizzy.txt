The Evil Wizard ZAKS is back! Like all Evil Wizards he had made certain arrangements against his premature demise... He has exacted a terrible revenge by transporting the YOLKFOLK to a stange Fairy-Tale World and casting evil spells on them to imprison them there forever.

Dizzy must free the SIX Yolkfolk by breaking the spells and then destroy ZAKS once and for all before he can return home.
