HE'S THE MEANEST SON OF A SNAKE YOU'VE EVER SEEN! 
HE'S THE HUMAN KILLING MACHINE 
 
CARVE OUT A PATH OF SAVAGE DESTRUCTION AS YOU BATTLE TO 
STAMP YOUR SUPREMACY OVER A MULTITUDE OF OPPONENTS. 
Face Igor the Fearless and his rabid dog amongst the sacred Temples of 
Moscow. Don't be fooled by ladies of the night, Maria and Helga, streetwise 
and toughened in the seedy underworld of Amsterdam. Match the cunning 
guile of Miguel, master bullfighter and the unvanquished fighting bull Brutus 
in the splendid surroundings of the Barcelona bull stag. Trade blows with 
the awesome Utan Hana and his drunken compatriot outside a German 
beerhouse. Finally confront the merciless terrorists of the Middle East 
among the battle torn ruins of Beirut. 
 
Tough and mean ... you're the HUMAN KILLING MACHINE!
