The time bomb is set. 
 
It's the only sure way to get rid of these aliens. For good. 
 
They're vile. Vicious. And villainous. 
 
And they've infested our outcolony. 
 
They're holding hundreds of inhabitants hostage. Some of them your friends. 
 
So get in there. And get blasting. 
 
Inside, you'll find state-of-the-art weaponry. It's yours for the taking. 
 
There's sector after sector to purge. Each more intricate than the one before it. 
 
And there are Super Aliens to confront. Each more hideous than the one before it. 
 
Get the hostages out. And get as many aliens as you can. Before the blast gets all of you.
