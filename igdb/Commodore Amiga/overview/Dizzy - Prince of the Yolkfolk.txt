Grand Dizzy was feeling very down one day, so Dizzy and Daisy decided to cheer him up by baking him his favourite food, cherry pie. "Pogie pinched the cheeries!" she cries, as she saw Pogies pawprint in the cupboard. Pogie promptly darted of into the enchanted forest to escape Daises rage.

Dizzy and Daisy decided to go into the forest to catch Pogie and gather some more cheeries at the same time. Whilst seaching for Pogie they got lost and found a castle, where they thought they would find help, but it seemed deserted. They looked in the castle for pogie, but Daisy caught herself on a mystic spinning wheel. She started feeling really sleepy, so she found a bed and went to sleep.

"Wake up Daisy, wake up!" shoued Dizzy. But before he could wake her up, Rockwart the troll caught him and locked him up underground.
