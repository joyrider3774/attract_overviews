Have you seen 2 Guys From Andromeda? Software Authors Pirated? 
 
The Two Guys from Andromeda, designers of the graphically extravagant (and satirically sensational) Space Quest series, have disappeared into this oxygen! Hysterical game fanatics around the world await word on the whereabouts of these celestial celebrities! 
 
Who could be the mastermind behind this evil plot? 
 
Could it be the Pirates of Pestulon, known for their plundering, preying and unprincipled practices? Or maybe the legions of Space Quest fans who would kill to be the first to play Space Quest III (the graphic adventure game with the closest thing yet to motion picture-quality animation). Not to be forgotten are the monkey-suited minions of Sludge Vohaul (from our last episode), who would love to make banana pudding out of those responsible for putting them behind bars. 
 
Who are the dirty deed doers behind our daring duo's demise? Is it too late to save the two guys from a disgusting and downright despicable doom? 
 
Holy SpaceWaste, space adventurers, find out for yourself as Roger Wilco, intergalactic garbagemen, returns to the rescue!
