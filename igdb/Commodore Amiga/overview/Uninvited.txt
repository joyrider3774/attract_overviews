What a pity about your automobile. And your sister, she came to our mansion for help. But now, I'm afraid she desperately needs yours! Welcome to our humble abode... I regret you'll have to carry on your search alone. It seems we're down to a skeleton staff. Oh my! Is that your sister screaming? I hope you're not too late to save her. Horrors! It's becoming grotesquely obvious why all our guests feel so... Uninvited!
