Hi there and a warm welcome to magic land.. former home of the magic Prince and his lovely bride to be. All was peace and harmony until the wicked witch lived up to those fabled danish fairly-tales and predictably turned the poor old Prince into nothing more than a little green frog.. But.. it was only a matter of a few hours beside the river-bank (being Prince's far-less-stately new home) when a strange bottle floated past.. intrigued, he grabbed it and drank from the bottle and the rest is history or at least it will be sooner or later.
