After successfully fighting the evil forces trying to conquer Krynn, the supreme evil itself wishes to take over the fight. Once again, it’s time to protect the land! As in the previous adventures, you need to build up your party, or import it from the previous game. If you prefer to, or haven’t played the previous game, you can create all-new characters.

The gameplay in Dark Queen of Krynn remains similar to the first two games, although the opponents do get tougher. The biggest difference is in the graphics. This game already features the 256 color VGA graphics. The sounds are supported by a SoundBlaster card, but the sound hasn’t really improved all that much.
