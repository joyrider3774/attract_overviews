You're in the depths of your own worst nightmare... but this time there's no waking up.

Lost and alone in a dangerous and alien world you must discover where you are, how you got here... and how you are going to get out!

In a frantic search of the unfamiliar land you explore amazing forests, mines and underground complexes collecting objects and interacting with indigenous creatures.

Re-emerging into daylight you race along perfect parallax action scenes, dispatching enemies as you battle even deeper into the unknown.

Impelling RPG with more than a dash of hack and slash.
