As the game starts, your party of adventurers has just won a great victory over evil Zhentarium forces at the ancient city of Ascore. But there is still trouble in the land. Far to the southeast, the dwarfs of Llorkh are fighting for their lives as they launched a rebellion against their Zhentarim masters. The black-cloaked forces of evil are counterattacking fiercely as they strive to hold the last Zhentarim base in the Savage Frontier.
