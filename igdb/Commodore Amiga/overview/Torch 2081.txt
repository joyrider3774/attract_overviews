Torch 2081 is a Tron-like game. You're a pilot in the World Military Service on the planet Torch. What was once your only concern, the defense of your planet against the warriors of Craylon, has now changed to an even greater, more difficult challenge. Fireballs, which are what remains of planets once destroyed during an earlier interplanetary nuclear war, are now bombarding the your planet's surface and destroying its inhabitants. You must now protect the surface of Torch. Using an old S.D.G. (surface defense glider) designed for defense of the planet against the Craylon race, you must use it to construct metallic panels above the planet surface increasing the structure of the candar shield. You must attempt to limit the flight area of the incoming fireballs by flying from panel to panel and edge to edge of your territory constructing new panels while avoiding your ships destruction.
