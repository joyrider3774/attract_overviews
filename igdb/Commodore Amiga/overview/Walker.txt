It's the most awesome machine of mass destruction ever to stalk your screen. Fitted with the most powerful twin cannons yet developed and a real mean attitude, the Walker has the destructive powers of an H-Bomb and the charisma of a Kalashnikov.

Featuring a unique control system which gives you total control over the movements and attack capabilities of this fearsome war monster, the only thing Walker leaves to the imagination is the smell of battle!
