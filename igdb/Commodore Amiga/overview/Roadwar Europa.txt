In the 21st century, Europe suffered the same bio-war that devastated America, a holocaust that established the deadly scenario for SSI's exciting Roadwar 2000. Now this sequel, Roadwar Europa, creates a post-doomsday Europe held hostage by maniacal terrorists. They have already destroyed one city with a dirty nuclear device and threaten to detonate five more across the continent. Before the United Nations cave in to the demands of the terrorists, it has agreed to a last desperate measure — send in the one man that can save Europe: You. 
 
Roadwar Europa starts off with you as the leader at a large road gang equipped with cars trucks, and motorcycles of your own design Transfer your crew from Roadwar 2000 or start from scratch and create a new elite band. 
 
Your mission is twofold: one, locate and disarm the five hidden bombs: two, pinpoint the enemy's headquarters and destroy the terrorist leaders. As you ride the highways and comb the great cities of Europe you'll battle mutants, cannibals and rival road gangs. You can let the computer resolve combat quickly, or choose to personally direct the fighting in great tactical detail. Order your men to fire with guns or crossbows, ram or board enemy vehicles. 
 
By fighting for new recruits, vehicles, supplies, ammunition and medicine, you'll maximize your chances for survival in this dangerous new world. You'll also be building up your forces to prepare for the final roadwar against the powerful terrorist leaders —a battle whose outcome will determine the future of all Europe.
