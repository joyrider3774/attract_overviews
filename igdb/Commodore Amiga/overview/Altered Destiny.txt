One minute you're just a guy eating nacho flavored popcorn. The next you're sucked through a TV into a fantastic alien world filled with exotic landscapes and lifeforms.

Welcome to the surprising new destiny of P.J. Barrett.

Follow P.J. through a marvelous universe of acid pools and frags, quirls and fluboxes, floaters and wraiths. There's a deep mystery that only he- with your help- can solve.

Put away the reality you've known. You won't be needing it this trip.
