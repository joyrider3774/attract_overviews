The all-new Silent Service II A State Of The Art Simulation Of Submarines In World War II.

Take command and live by the motto FIND 'EM, CHASE 'EM, SINK 'EM, as you follow instruments, charts and your instincts in search of hostile convoys. Is a submerged daylight periscope attack best or do you charge in on the surface at night using only radar bearings to guide you? Do you fire a spread of your precious torpedoes or can you close the range and pick off the enemy with a single torpedo shot? These decisions and many more are yours to make as you take your place among the elite ranks of the Silent Service.
