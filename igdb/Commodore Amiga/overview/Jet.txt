Then you can select from a variety of land-sea strike or dogfight options to test your combat performance. Jet carries an internal M61 machine gun, and can be fitted with air-to-air missiles. AGM missiles or bombs as required. Standard equipment also includes search radar, an automatic target tracking/sequencing computer, and fully functioning ejection seat.
