The quest for freedom!

When you can't remember who you are, where you are, and even what year it is, then you know trouble cannot be to far away...

Held Captive for two hundred years in an orbiting space prison for a crime you didn't commit, you are desperate to escape from your electronic jail.

Armed only with a briefcase computer found in the corner of your cell, you start sending out SOS calls to the battling world outside.

Eventually you find a motley crew of four droids ready to help bring about your escape.

...so begins your quest to freedom!
