Take a classic arcade game. Add a whole heap of seasoning in the form of stylish, state-of-the-art graphics and four massive levels of up-to-date action. Stir in an alternative dimension, exquisitely evil aliens and a heavy-sprinkling of mucho-big guns 'n' power-propped planes. Leave to simmer on an incandescent heat and wait for the best blast in light years.
