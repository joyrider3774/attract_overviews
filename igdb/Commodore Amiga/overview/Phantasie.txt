The Isle of Gelnor is divided by a chain of mountains into two regions. The west is the traditional domain of human and humanoid beings - with a few renegade Orcs and Lizardmen - dedicated to order and goodness. The east is inhabited by more exotic creatures - dragons, trolls and giants. These regions have been waging war throughout the history of the Great land.

Since the Great invasion by the evil sorcerer Nikademus, the isle of Gelnor has been terrorized by his merciless Black Knights. To maintain their reign of terror, the Black Knights travel from town to town, demanding sacrifices and homage.

You are an adventurer looking for fame and fortune, as most of them do, and you see your chance here. Those Black Knights deserves your attention no matter the costs.
