The game has five levels, each of which was divided into two different type of stages. The first stage involves controlling the international teen heroes (Planeteers) flying their Eco-Jet to an enemy fortress while trying to avoid the instant death that occurs by touching any of the scenery or getting hit by the various projectiles or birds. The second stage involves controlling Captain Planet himself as he fights his way to a ecovillain from the TV series.
