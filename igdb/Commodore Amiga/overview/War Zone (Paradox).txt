In a futuristic 1999 setting, you an your partner (Co-op available) have been detailed to lead a counter-invasion force to push back enemy which has landed at eight strategic points in your country. However, the rest of your crew has been killed or captured, so now it's up to you. Your prime directive is to shoot your way through eight levels of top-down scrolling action for a date with the end-of-level guardian of each, be it a tank, helicopter, submarine or some other piece of military hardware. Along the way it would be nice if you could free the rest of your unit also.
