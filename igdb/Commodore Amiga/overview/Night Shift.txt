Night Shift is a unique action game where the hero is a worker in a factory owned by Industrial Might and Logic (a parody of Industrial Light and Magic). Your character ensures that the factory is working properly as it cranks out Star Wars action figures, including those of stormtroopers and Darth Vader. The object of the game is to always ensure the factory is working properly, and to move in an increasingly better home.
