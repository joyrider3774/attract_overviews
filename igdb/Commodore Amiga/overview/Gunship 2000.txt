Gunship 2000 is a helicopter simulation game. The game consists of a set of missions mostly search and destroy or survival style. The simulation engine is quite real and complex to understand but simulates almost all aspects of the war environment. Your main purpose is to destroy the primary and secondary targets. You are not rewarded for missing those objects, even if you manage to destroy everything else. The really successful pilots are rewarded for hitting the targets and getting back in less than thirty minutes.
