Sensible World of Soccer was designed and developed by Sensible Software as the 1994 sequel to their 1992 hit game Sensible Soccer which combined a 2D football game with a comprehensive manager mode. All the players in all of the teams from all of the professional leagues in the world from that time are included, as well as all of the national and international competitions for all club and national teams around the world. Altogether there are over 1,500 teams and 27,000 players included in the game. Although the gameplay is very simple (just eight directions and one fire button needed) a large variety of context sensitive actions can be performed easily without any predefined keys.
