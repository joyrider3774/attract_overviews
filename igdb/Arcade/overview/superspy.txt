The Super Spy （ザ・スーパー・スパイ） is an early Neo Geo game released by SNK in 1990. It is a first-person shooter and beat 'em up game with action RPG elements in which players move through the many floors of an office building shooting terrorists.[1] It was an early example of a first-person shooter where the player character's arms and weapons are visible on screen.[2][3] In 1991, SNK's Crossed Swords had similar gameplay, but with more RPG elements and hack & slash combat instead of shooting and fist-fighting.
