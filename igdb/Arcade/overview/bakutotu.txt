Bakutotsu Kijūtei (lit. "Bomb Thrust Machine Gun Vessel"), also known by its longer title as Bakutotsu Kijūtei: Baraduke II, is a scrolling shooter arcade game that was released by Namco in 1988 only in Japan. As in the original game, the players again take control of Takky (Player 1) and Hommy (Player 2) while fighting the strange-looking Octy and saving the one-eyed Paccets.
