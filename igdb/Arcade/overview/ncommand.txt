The overall gameplay is similar to this of the run-and-gun classic Ikari Warriors,[1] with the players battling their way up the top-down perspective screen. The players can choose between three ninja characters, all with differing abilities. Each of them has fighting game-style[1] input commands that unleash their scroll-based ninpo special moves. As usual in the genre, the game's stages end with boss battles.
