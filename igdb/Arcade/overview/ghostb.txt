A 3-player top-down arcade game where one player controls one of three unidentified ghost-busters. The game is based off of The Real Ghostbusters cartoon, rather than strictly off the movie franchise. 
The player can choose between a red, yellow or blue-jumpsuited character though all have the same abilities. These powers include an energy gun that transforms a hostile monster into a harmless, basic ghost, which are then captured using the proton beam. Other abilities are an invincibility field and the ability to summon Slimer to absorb attacks instead of the player. 
 In Japan the game is known as Meikyuu Hunter G, but bears little resemblance to the western version as it did not use the Ghostbusters license.
