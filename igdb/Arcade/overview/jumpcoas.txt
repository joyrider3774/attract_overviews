In this game, you maneuver a caped man along roller-coaster tracks, grabbing money bags and trying to save your girlfriend, all the while avoiding cops and gorillas (which either swing on the ropes and throw deadly bananas and apples at you, or ride in roller-coaster cars, intent on hitting you.) 
 
The game has four screens in each level. Each screen is completed in one of two ways: getting to your girlfriend, or grabbing all the money bags on the screen, then getting the large money bag which appears.
