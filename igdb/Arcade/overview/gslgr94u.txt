Baseball arcade game that had been released by Namco in June 1994; it runs on the company's NB-1 hardware, and as the name suggests, it is the sequel to Great Sluggers (which was released exclusively in Japan the year before). However, instead of the twelve teams of Japan's Central and Pacific Leagues, the players must take control of two of the twenty-eight teams of the American League and National League - and there are two teams for both Chicago and New York.
