Battle Flip Shot (sometimes also referred to simply as Flip Shot) is a 1998 ball-and-paddle game developed and published by Visco exclusively for the arcade cabinet known as the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware. It combines the genres of the Magnavox Odyssey Tennis game, Atari's Pong and Breakout arcades, and Nintendo's Spitball Sparky of the Game & Watch series. In 2001, Visco created and released Bang Bead, the follow-up to Battle Flip Shot.
