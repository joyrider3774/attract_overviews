Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder is a side-scrolling arcade hack 'n' slash game released in 1992 by Sega. It was the first 32-bit game in the series. It still remains an arcade exclusive as of 2010. 
 
The player characters are Goah the giant, Stern the barbarian, Dora the Kentauride, and Little Trix, a young elf lad who carries a pitchfork. None of the characters from the first game are playable, although Gilius Thunderhead from the first game rides on Goah's back. The main enemy is once again Death Adder.
