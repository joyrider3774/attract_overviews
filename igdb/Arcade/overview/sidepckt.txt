Side Pocket is a pocket billiards video game originally released into arcades by Data East in 1986. The arcade version was eventually ported to six home console platforms and two sequels to the game were produced, as well as a spin-off series called Pocket Gal. G-Mode currently owns the intellectual property rights to the Side Pocket series, and licenses these games globally.
