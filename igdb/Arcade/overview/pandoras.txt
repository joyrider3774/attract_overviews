Taking on the role of a Roman emperor, replete with white robe and olive leaf head ornament, the player must make his or her way from the top left of the screen to the bottom right, via careful navigation of a variety of poles and moving platforms. Enemies can push the player character into fires or over the edge of platforms if they are not carefully avoided.
