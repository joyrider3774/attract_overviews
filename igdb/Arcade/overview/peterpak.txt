The player maneuvers Peter, a cartoon rodent, through various environments to collect objects and take them back to his nest within a designated time. Enemies, referred to as "The Gang", include cats, dogs, owls, and spiders, and must be avoided or stunned by throwing gems or collected objects. Each successive stage increases the number of objects to collect, reduces the allotted time to collect them, and adds more enemies.
