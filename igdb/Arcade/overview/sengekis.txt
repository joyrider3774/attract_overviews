Sengeki Striker (閃激ストライカー) is a vertically scrolling shooter created by Warashi and Kaneko for the arcade and released in 1997. 
 
The scoring system of Sengeki Striker is not well-understood. It is known that destroying enemy ships so that the explosion takes out other enemies, and using the Gambits to destroy targets, are worth points. 
 
Sengeki Striker bears some visual resemblance to Shienryu, a previous game by Warashi.
