This strategy RPG is a remastered compilation of two earlier Shining force titles: Shining Force Gaiden (originally released in Japan only) and Shining Force: The Sword of Hajya, both for the Game Gear. The two stories put players in the role of Nick, a hero of royal blood who must rescue Queen Anri of Gardiana and reclaim the kingdom of Cypress from the evil empire of Iom's clutches.
