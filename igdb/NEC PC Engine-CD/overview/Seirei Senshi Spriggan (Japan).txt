Take on the alien hordes in this vertically scrolling shoot 'em up from the people behind Aleste. The power-up system in Spriggan relies on different coloured globes - you can have three of these in stock at any one time and the order they are in will vary what style of weapon you have. This allows for a certain degree of mix-and-match until you find your preferred combination. You can also eject these orbs, which act as a smart bomb in times of need.
