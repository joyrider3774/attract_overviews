2nd Impact brought back all the characters from the first game and introduced two new ones: Hugo and Urien. Yang, who was an alternate version of Yun in the first game, became his own character with his own set of special moves and super arts. Akuma also returned as a secret computer-controlled challenger and selectable character. Thus the playable character roster increased to 14. In addition to the regular Akuma, a non-playable computer-controlled version named "Shin Akuma" also appears in the single-player mode.
