Boogie Wings (known in Japan as The Great Ragtime Show (ザ・グレイト・ラグタイムショー?)) is a side-scrolling shooter arcade game released by Data East in 1992. The game contains unique gameplay, along with many nonsensical or comedic themes not present in other games of the genre, but was never ported to other consoles because of its relative unpopularity in arcade centers.
