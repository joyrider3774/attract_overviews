Prehistoric Isle 2 is complete madness. You pick one of two available helicopters, and blast your way through six increasingly difficult stages. The only thing in your way are dinosaurs, which just so happen to have the ability to breath fire, shoot lasers, and want nothing more than to see you perish! It’s completely insane, and that’s what makes it so bloody great! It doesn’t hurt any that the game was developed by the same people who made the excellent Blazing Star and Pulstar so you know you’re in for a good time.
