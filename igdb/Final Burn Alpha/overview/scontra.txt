Super Contra is a Run and Gun-style action game produced by Konami, originally released as a coin-operated arcade game in 1988. It is the sequel to the original Contra and the second game in the Contra series released for the arcades. Like in the original game, the game centers on soldiers Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, who are once again assigned to protect the Earth from an army of alien invaders. The game features standard side-scrolling stages, as well as all new overhead stages in lieu of the original game's "3D" stages. 
 
Like its predecessor, a modified console version was made for the Nintendo Entertainment System, which saw release in North America as Super C and in Europe and Australia as Probotector II: Return of the Evil Forces. Both the arcade game and the NES game, have been re-released in various other platforms since their original releases.
