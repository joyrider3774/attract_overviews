As a super cop you have limited time to find a bomb in a large building. You can ride elevators, escalators and climb ladders in the search. 
There are assorted obstacles and bad guys to avoid or shoot -- "Killers" will shoot back. Nice death sequence where the bad guys escape on a helicopter while you go up the screen as an angel. 
 
Find the bomb and the bad guys will surrender. Between levels there is bonus stage where you pick from various boxes to get a bomb, bonus stage over, or additional points. 
 
Graphics are very blocky and crude, but quite large. The game looks like a variation of Elevator Action but with worse graphics! Music is terribly irritating and the overall game appears quite dated.
