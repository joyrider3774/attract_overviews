Street Fighter II Turbo: Hyper Fighting[a] is a competitive fighting game released for the arcade by Capcom in 1992. It is the third game in the Street Fighter II sub-series of Street Fighter games following Street Fighter II: Champion Edition. Released less than a year after the previous installment, Hyper Fighting introduced a faster playing speed and new special moves for certain characters, as well as further refinement to the character balance. 
 
Hyper Fighting is the final arcade game in the Street Fighter II series to use the original CP System hardware. It was distributed as an upgrade kit designed to be installed into Champion Edition printed circuit boards.[3] The next game in the series, Super Street Fighter II, uses the CP System's successor, the CP System II.
