Desert Assault or Thunder Zone is a isometric scrolling military themed shoot 'em up game where you take control of one of four commandos operating in the Persian gulf. Each commando has their own look and special limited bomb. 
 
As you walk through the stages you fight a variety of enemies on foot, vehicles, static guns and bosses. While playing destroyed enemies drop weapons and items to restore hit points that can be picked up. Weapons include a shotgun, machinegun, bazooka, rocket launcher and flamethrower. Sometimes a vehicle must be mounted. These include a car and some kind of desert/snowmobile. There are two and four player versions. In the slightly different Japanese version the second stage takes place in the Artic while in the other versions the second stage takes place in the desert.
