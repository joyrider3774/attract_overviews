Bad Dudes vs. DragonNinja is a game developed by Data East for an Upright Arcade cabinet, and became a part of gaming history mainly due to the incorporation of the cut scene. Ironically, it was generally viewed with criticism, but still made a significant contribution to the development of video game design. It was ported onto many different platforms, and was also released on the Nintendo Wii as a part of a classic games package.
