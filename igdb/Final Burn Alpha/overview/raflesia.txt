Rafflesia is a top view vertical scrolling shooter where the screen scrolls constantly as you fly up the screen in your spacecraft. The aim is to blast or avoid the various aliens that move around the screen to finally face the final boss Rafflesia. As you blast and avoid, you are equipped with two weapons, both are forward firing weapons but the second one is more powerful and when in use decreases your energy. Falling down the screen constantly are tears from Rafflesia and when collected these increase your energy. If you are hit by an alien or it's weapon then you lose one of three lives. Two players can play with each player taking it in turn when the other player is killed.
