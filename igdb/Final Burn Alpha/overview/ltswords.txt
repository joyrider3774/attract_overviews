Lightning swords, known as Ken-Go in Japan, is an arcade 2D side-scrolling beat-em up - the game is set in a time when Ninjas and Samurai were active. The player is a samurai, armed with a sharp katana. He needs to go to the right, through locations in traditional Japan, and cut all the enemies that appear on his way. Holding down the attack button gives a special blow. At the end of each level a boss awaits - usually big, strong and durable.
