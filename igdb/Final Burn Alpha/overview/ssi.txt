Super Space Invaders '91 was produced by Taito in 1990. The gameplay adheres much to the original, making it very easy to play. The object in most cases is to simply clear the screen of invaders before they reach bottom. Every so often, however, a boss invader appears that must be hit multiple times to be destroyed.
