"Guitar Hero On Tour: Modern Hits brings a Modern Rock twist to Guitar Hero for the DS. With the new Fan Request mode, you can choose your path to music stardom and rock the house! On-the-go rockers earn more fans and fame by performing their favorite tunes in different styles (e.g. avoiding note bombs, hitting a 300 note streak or playing different guitar tracks) as requested by their fans while they move back and forth between venues (non-linear gameplay). Utilizing the familiar Guitar Hero Guitar Grip peripheral, gamers can shred through 28 master tracks of the hottest Modern Rock."
