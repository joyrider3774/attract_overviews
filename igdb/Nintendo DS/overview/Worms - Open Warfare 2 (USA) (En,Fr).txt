"Worms: Open Warfare 2 features a ton of single player content, new multiplayer modes like Forts mode and Race mode and of course you can customize teams and schemes to your heartâ€™s content. On Nintendo DS the gameplay takes place spread over both screens, there is full support for all wireless modes including Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection and the included landscape and flag editors are designed specifically for touch screen use.

The Nintendo DS exclusive Laboratory mode features three types of experiments; Blow, Blast and Draw. Blow asks you to guide a parachuting worm to the exit by controlling the airflow in the level, Blast sees the player making explosions on screen to blast their worm to the exit and Draw allows players to draw directly onto the landscape to save a worm from being blasted into the water."
