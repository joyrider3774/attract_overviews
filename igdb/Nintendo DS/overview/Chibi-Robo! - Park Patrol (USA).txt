A pollution epidemic is killing off flowers and ravaging parks worldwide. To combat this threat, Citrusoft Robotics has developed an eco-friendly model of Chibi-Robo and sent it to parks everywhere. As Chibi-Robo, players restore their local park to its former glory by raising flowers and plants, building park equipment and defeating toxic enemies called Smoglings.
