Updated version of the classic Puyo Puyo puzzle game featuring the all-new "fever" mode. Better known in the west under the titles Puyo Pop, Kirby's Avalanche and Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, Puyo Pop Fever still follows the classic bubble-popping format (align four or more "puyos" to make them pop), but Sega also delivers completely overhauled visuals with a more hand-drawn look, an expanded roster of characters, and a new "Fever Mode" that cranks up the action to frantic degrees once players fill a "fever gauge" on their screen. Although a four-player mode didn't make the cut, two players can go head to head and compete for points or survival.
