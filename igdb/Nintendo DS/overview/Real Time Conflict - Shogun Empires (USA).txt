In Shogun Empires, players assume the role of one of two brothers who are locked in bloody combat in feudal Japan. Conquering neighboring territories and amassing formidable armies, only one warrior is able to survive the deadly endgame to realize his ambitions and claim the title of Shogun. In their quest to become Shogun, players utilize the Nintendo DS's touch screen to plot complex battle plans while watching the action play out through detailed 3D graphics on the top screen. Touch screen mini-games such as duels, castle sieges and sea battles enhance the battle experience and give Shogun Warrior impressive gameplay variety and replay value. In between encounters, gamers are able to use diplomacy and military strategy to manage their forces. For the ultimate in feudal warfare, up to 8 players can engage in enormous clashes through the wireless multiplayer capabilities of the Nintendo DS.
