The plot centers around Indy's search for the Staff of Moses. The game is mostly about a quest which takes you around the world on various quests, fighting Nazis, Panamanian hunters, and Tong thugs, and trying to find artifacts which will unlock other possible things for you to get and do. Although the staff of Moses is never mentioned in the beginning of the game, the plot is set about finding the staff, but the actual part of the story where the quest about finding the staff of Moses first start taking place is a lot further on in the game
