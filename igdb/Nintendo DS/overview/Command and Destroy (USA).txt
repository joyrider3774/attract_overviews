Command and Destroy brings army-based Real Time Strategy game play to the Nintendo DS for the very first time. Set in the future on a colonial outpost in deep space, two different species are pitted against each other due to Alien invasion. Players get to decide whether to play the role of the humans, defiantly standing up to the alien onslaught, or whether you'd like to control the extra terrestrials hell-bent on the destruction of the human race.
