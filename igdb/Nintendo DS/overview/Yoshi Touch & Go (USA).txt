Yoshi and Baby Mario are back together at long last, and it'll take a steady hand to guide them through their latest adventure. As Yoshi charges across the island, you use the stylus to throw eggs at enemies, lead him to egg-replenishing fruit, and make him jump over danger. On vertical-scrolling levels, you use the stylus to draw clouds to encircle enemies, throw coins, and guide Baby Mario through the dangerous skies. Take on the single-player challenges or compete against a friend using the wireless link of the Nintendo DS.
