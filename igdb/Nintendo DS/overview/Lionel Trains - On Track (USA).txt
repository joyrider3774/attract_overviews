The gameplay of Lionel Trains: On Track is very similar to Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon series of computer games. In the game, you are the head of an unspecified railroad, and your objective is to connect different cities together through rail, using the funds you start off with, and later earn. There are several separate modes of gameplay, with varying objectives.
