Reception: 
Lucas M. Thomas of IGN said that, "Most games like this deserve ridicule, but that this one doesn't because the fans will like it. "Common Sense Media said that the game is well-designed and that it has high entertainment value, but that the game might be too easy for some kids. Matt Paddock of Game Vortex said that the only flaw is the bad grammar and negative talk.
