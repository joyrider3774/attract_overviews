Experience the feel and finesse of real golf on beautiful 3D courses with True Swing Golf. In this dual-screened Nintendo DS golf game, using the touch screen and the stylus is almost like swinging a golf club in real life. The longer players slide a stylus across the touch screen, the harder they smack the ball. Players also can curve their swings to slice or fade shots and alter the angle of the club head for sharpshooter-like accuracy. True Swing Golf features multiple game modes, character customization and wireless multiplayer support for up to four players with just one game card.
