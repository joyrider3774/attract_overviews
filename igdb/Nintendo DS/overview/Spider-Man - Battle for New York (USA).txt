Spider-Man: Battle for New York allows players to take on the role of Spider-Man, and one of his famed nemeses, Green Goblin. For the first time in a handheld Spider-Man game players can personalize their experiences by choosing what abilities and powers to upgrade and when, such as Spider-Man’s web maneuvers or Green Goblin’s fire attacks.
