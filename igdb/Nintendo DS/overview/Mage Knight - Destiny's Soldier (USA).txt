The year is 435 Tz, and every faction in the Land is at war, and if it continues there won't be much Land left to fight over. The strain on the world's magical energy is literally tearing the Land apart. The Land's fate lies in your hands. You must fight hard and earn the respect of all the races of the Land, and together you must fight to keep the Land alive. Travel the Land earning respect points by battling small armies that you'll find along your journey, and eventually work your way up to all out war. The more respect points you gain, the more inclined warriors will be to join your army.
