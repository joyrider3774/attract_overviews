Using the Touch Screen, players tap the Nintendo DS stylus to swap the positions of animals on screen to create lines of three or more of the same type. These animals are then "captured", allowing other animals to fall into their place. This easy to pick-up and intuitive system is complimented by a unique look designed by the popular the Japanese developer.
