Mama develops her wilderness skills in Camping Mama: Outdoor Adventures that features 100 different stylus based games across a broad range of challenges. Craft a fishing pole, use it to fish then cook your catch; capture wild chickens for a tasty egg breakfast; set up your tent; collect exotic insects and much more. 
 
Both girls and boys can enjoy fun outdoor activities like rock climbing, spelunking, rowing and tree climbing as they navigate 38 different levels that span forests, mountains and seas. Would-be campers can choose to play as either the son or daughter with Mama or Papa providing guidance depending on the challenge. With customization options and collectible play, Camping Mama lets everyone go wild in the great outdoors.
