The Clue Bender Society, a group consisting of the world's greatest detectives, is looking for their newest member. Teen super-sleuth Nancy Drew is among three exceptional candidates that could make the cut if she can solve a series of pre-determined challenges before the others. But when a secret tome containing the solutions to history's greatest mysteries goes missing, the Clue Bender Society's test case becomes real; they turn to Nancy and the other applicants to help recover the book before it ends up in the wrong hands. With only 24 hours to solve the case and earn membership into the Society, Nancy Drew will have to be at the top of her game.
