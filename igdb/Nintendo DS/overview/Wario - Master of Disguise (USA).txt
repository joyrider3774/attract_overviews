The world's most low-down and ornery garlic-lover never lets a get-rich quick scheme pass him by. Wario: Master of Disguise opens with our money-mad hero taking a break from being a shady software impresario to watch a TV show about a master thief. Working himself up into a lather of jealousy, Wario leaps through the screen and embarks on his own glamorous globe-trotting career as a thief. 
With the helpful advice of a mustachioed magic wand named Goodstyle, you'll soon learn how to use your DS stylus to draw specific designs on Wario to give him new costumes. Break into exotic locations, from a luxury liner & watery ruins to an Egyptian pyramid, all in the hopes of grabbing as much treasure and loot as Wario can carry.
