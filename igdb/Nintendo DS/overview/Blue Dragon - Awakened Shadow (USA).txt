Awakened Shadow is designed to take full advantage of the Nintendo DS capabilities allowing players to engage in impressive boss battles with up to two friends and earn and trade items via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection in multiplayer mode. Players will be able to attack enemies faster than ever before with upgraded weapons and powerful Shadows, which can be switched for tactical advantages. Players will roam a 3D open world environment across several unique “cube” worlds as they take on formidable Otherworld bosses, complete multiple challenges, and recruit over a dozen characters in their own custom adventure.
