A crazy departure from your normal Pokémon game, Pokémon Trozei is a speedy puzzle game that will send your stylus flying! Your goal is to match the faces of four Pokémon in the game board to remove them, then string together more Pokémon faces to perform big combos. The Pokémon keep coming faster and faster, increasing the challenge the more you play. When you clear a set of Pokémon, that Pokémon will be added to your Pokédex, so look out for rare and special Pokémon to clear from the board! All of the 386 Pokémon available through Pokémon FireRed Version and Pokémon LeafGreen Version are in Pokémon Trozei, but it'll take a great many games to catch them all!
