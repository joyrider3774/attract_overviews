In Madagascar 3: The Video Game, players must help Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Gloria the Hippo, and Melman the Giraffe find a way home while working for a traveling circus. In single or two player co-op mode, players will travel across Europe to promote the circus by completing challenging and zany missions given by the Penguins, performing amazing publicity stunts on some of Europe's most notable landmarks, and dazzling the crowd with fun circus acts fit only for a Madagascar-style circus extravaganza!
