Based on episodes from VIZ Media's hit anime series Shonen Jump Naruto, the new game features a unique time-based combat system in which players must determine each character's strengths and use them accurately to help them defeat the enemy. Choosing from six available characters, players explore the Village Hidden in the Leaves and the world of Naruto as they roam across forests, fields, rivers and mountains. Along the way players encounter bosses and enemies that they must use their special techniques to defeat.
