Student by day. Pop star by night. 
 
The latest game based on the hit Disney Channel series, Hannah Montana , Hannah Montana: Music Jam, transports you into the exciting and sometimes crazy world of Miley Stewart and her alter ego Hannah Montana. Adventure out as Hannah or Miley, and develop musical talents, coordinate high fashions, and live out the dream of becoming a pop star in Hannah’s greatest musical challenge yet. 
 
Enter the Music Jam Video competition and compete against Savannah Star — a rising new singer out to challenge Hannah — at the same time as a cool new transfer student, Josie Moore, seems to be stealing all of Miley’s friends. To help her win the competition, use the Nintendo DS Touch Screen to master the guitar and drums. In a mix of adventure and creative modes, control Hannah/Miley as she composes her Music Jam Video entries, keeps her friends happy, and in the end, learns a little something about what it means to be a real star.
