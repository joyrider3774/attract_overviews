N+ is a port of the original Adobe Flash based PC game, N, to console and handheld systems with new features.

"N+ is a peerless action-puzzle platformer with more than 300 levels in which to hone your ninja reflexes, plus a built-in level editor for when you're hungry for more. N+ also features unique, physics-based controls, stylish graphics, unlimited lives, competitive and cooperative multiplayer, plenty of gold, and several flavors of sweet, sweet action."

"N+ features N doesn't have:
-Redesigned graphics and visual effects: a more detailed version of N's in-your-face minimalist style
-New objects and enemies: Pulse Drone, Laser Turret and Zap Doors
-Background music and next-gen 5.1 surround sound
-Way over 400 all-new levels
-3 pants-wettingly good modes of multiplayer: Co-op, Race and Survival"
