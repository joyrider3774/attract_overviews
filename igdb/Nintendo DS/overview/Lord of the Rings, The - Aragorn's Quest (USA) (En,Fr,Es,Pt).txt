The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest takes its cues from the massive Peter Jackson movie trilogy, featuring varied and memorable settings and the actors' likenesses that have become synonymous with their respective characters. A cartoon style is used for the nicely animated visuals which gives the game a refreshingly distinct look while remaining faithful to the style of The Lord of the Rings. 
 
An attractive pencil interpretation of the story draws you into the game and brings you up to speed on the events of the films, accompanied by some of the Academy Award winning score that helped make the movies so emotionally powerful. From there you're treated to a brilliant array of flashy graphics and atmospheric music which changes dramatically when you're set upon by Sauron's evil allies. 
 
The superb sound effects also recreate the intense mood of the movies, with the chilling wail of the Dark Riders, howling wolves, battle cries of lumbering trolls and the metallic ring of clashing swords in battle making you feel like you're right in the middle of an epic and thrilling quest.
