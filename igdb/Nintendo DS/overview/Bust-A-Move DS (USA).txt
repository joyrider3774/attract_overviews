Bust-A-Move DS brings all of the bubble bursting, puzzle fun onto the Nintendo DS. This time Bub and Bob return to center stage as they fling bubbles from the bottom screen to the top in an attempt to match 3 bubbles causing them to pop. With a multiplayer mode allowing 5 people to play via the Nintendo DS' wireless link, this Bust-A-Move will prove to be the ultimate battle party game.
