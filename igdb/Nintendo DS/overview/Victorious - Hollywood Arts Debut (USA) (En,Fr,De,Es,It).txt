Victorious: Hollywood Arts Debut for the Nintendo DS will immerse players in Hollywood Arts High School, where they attend a full year as a new student and enjoy adventures alongside Tori, Andr√©, Cat and the Victorious gang. For the first time, players can attend the school and experience classes and funny situations, pulled right from the show in the form of dynamic, replayable mini-games that exist in Freeplay and Story Mode. The unique and hilarious setup allows players to decide their fate so they can rise to fame by earning a lead role in the Big Showcase, the biggest performance of the year!
