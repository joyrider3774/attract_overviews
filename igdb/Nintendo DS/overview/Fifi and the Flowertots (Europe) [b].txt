Fifi and the Flowertots for the Nintendo DS is a collection of mini games and puzzles for children a little older than when they first watched the realted TV show. There are fifteen different games to play including wordsearch, sudoku, spot the difference and jigsaw. Each game has three different difficulties and medals for kids to win, which promotes a sense of pride and motivation. Although Fifi and her garden companions are aimed at preschool children, this DS game raises the bar for those a little older.
