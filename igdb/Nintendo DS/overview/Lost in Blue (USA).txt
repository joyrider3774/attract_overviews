Lost in Blue lets you follow a girl and a boy who are stranded on a seemingly uninhabited island. While planning their escape, the two learn survival skills, such as hunting, gathering food, and building tools. You can play the game first as the boy, and then play as the girl for a completely different experience. To survive in this adventure, you'll need to learn how to share responsibilities with your partner.
