Kirby: Squeak Squad, known in Europe as Kirby: Mouse Attack and in Japan as Kirby of the Stars: Calling on the Dorotche Gang (Japanese: 星のカービィ 参上! ドロッチェ団 Hepburn: Hoshi no Kābī Sanjō! Dorocche Dan?), is a 2006-07 platforming video game developed by HAL Laboratory, Flagship and Natsume (the latter as seen in the end credits) and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld video game console. Unlike the previous Nintendo DS title, Kirby: Canvas Curse, Squeak Squad is a traditional platformer which uses the face buttons instead of the touch screen to control Kirby.
