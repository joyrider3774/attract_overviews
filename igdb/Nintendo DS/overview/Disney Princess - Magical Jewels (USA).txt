Disney Princess: Magical Jewels for Nintendo DS invites girls to play as their favorite Disney Princesses in an enchanted adventure. Girls explore the game at their own pace and skill level to recover the Magical Jewels and restore the magical power of a kingdom. In a magic-filled romp through locations familiar to young girls, players experience the excitement of interacting with the environments through the Nintendo DS touch screen to solve puzzles and tasks that help each Princess on her adventure. A tiered design provides an accessible play experience for the younger player, yet also provides layers of challenges for older players. Multiplayer modes allow the player to have a friend join the fun.
