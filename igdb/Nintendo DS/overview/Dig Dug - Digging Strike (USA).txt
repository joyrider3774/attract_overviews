This 3D adventure combines the classic arcade digging action with new baddies, environments, weapons, mini-games and strategies to deliver the most action-packed Dig Dug game to date. Whether tackling the underground alone or wirelessly with a friend, gamers discover 15 stages with more than 80 areas in Dig Dug Digging Strike. Players explore 3D environments on the top screen of the DS, then plunge underground on the bottom screen to dig and connect fault lines that will trap monsters. Only by sinking enemy bosses do players move to the next level - and they encounter some familiar faces along the way. The dreaded Pooka and Fygar are back to threaten Dig Dug, along with a host of never-before-seen bosses. Dig Dug is armed with a series of thrilling weapons to combat monsters as well as elements from the environment including rolling rocks, quicksand and flowing lava.
