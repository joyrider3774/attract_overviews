Mega Man Battle Network 5: Double Team is a dual screen version of the Game Boy Advance title. The DS will combine both Team Protoman and Team Colonel in one game, but add specific content unique to the Nintendo DS version. The second screen comes into play by giving players direct access to their Cyber Map and PET. The microphone can be "yelled" into to power up Mega Man during battle. And using the Nintendo DS's GBA slot, players can carry over battle chips earned in past Mega Man Battle Network games for use in the Nintendo DS edition.
