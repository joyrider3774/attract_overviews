Super Dodgeball Brawlers has over 100 ball-busting special attacks! Dish out a variety of pain with over 100 special attacks with their own special animations and effects, like the Cactus Attack and Panda Shot. The Perfect Game for Multiplayer Mayhem! Compete in a traditional game of dodgeball against a friend or take part in a multiplayer street brawl with up to 8 players with a single Game Card. Finally, an open season for Violence! If the old-fashioned way doesn't work for you, you can now use punches, kicks, and even weapons against the opposing team.
