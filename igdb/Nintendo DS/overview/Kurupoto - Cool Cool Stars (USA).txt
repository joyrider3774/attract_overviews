The stars have fallen from the sky! The only thing that can help the stars regain their power is the haloes that were scattered all over Kurupoto Island when they fell. As a star worshipper, it is up to you, the Kurupoto, to free these haloes from the puzzles they are stuck in and get your beloved stars shining in the sky once more.
