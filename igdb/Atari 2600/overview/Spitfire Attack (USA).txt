Spitfire Attack is a flight simulator/target shooting game. Shoot down the enemy planes, and destroy various ground installations, including anti-aircraft guns that shoot at you. The game was packaged with the large Flight Command Controller, which was a glorified joystick that had the look of an aircraft machine gun.
