Berenstain Bears comes with three different cassette tapes that are designed to be used with the Kid Vid Controller (originally packaged with Smurfs Save the Day - the only other Kid Vid game). The cartridge won't do much without the tapes. At the beginning of each game, Actual Factual Bear takes off while you control Brother Bear on his unicycle. Avoid the boulders and cross the bridge to reach one of the games, chosen by the particular tape you are listening to. The games are: 
Big Number Hunt: Catch the correct numbers as they fall from the tree 
Great Letter Roundup: Catch the correct letters as they fall from the tree 
Spooky Spelling Bee: Spell a word by catching the letters falling from the tree
