Steeplechase is a 6-player arcade game by Atari Inc., originally released in 1975 and simulating a steeplechase-style horse race. Up to six players can play against each other, each choosing a horse while the computer controls the seventh horse on the bottom. Each player's horse begins galloping, and the players must jump over obstacles in their lanes by pressing their colored buttons. The horse that successfully jumps all obstacles smoothly becomes the fastest horse and wins.
