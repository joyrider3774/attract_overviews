During an intergalactic war. a timewarp was created and mankind was warped back into the past. Now mankind is stuck in the stone age and it just so happens they start getting attacked by Amazon condors. Also of concern are other enemies of mankind that traveled back in time with them, the Nirobean Spiders and the vulcanian bats. Being the only one who has a futuristic weapon (a galactic disintegrator) that survived this timewarp, it's up to the player to repel these menacing creatures and hope the few surviving scientists are able to find a way back into the future.
