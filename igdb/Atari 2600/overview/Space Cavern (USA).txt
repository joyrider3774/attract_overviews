As a commander of a spaceship you explore an unknown planet and are soon attacked by its inhabitants - the Electrosauri. You are shot at from above as well as from the sides and it becomes increasingly difficult to fend off the attackers the further the game progresses. The game allows the player to play several variations (e.g. difficulty level, number of enemies on screen, attack patterns etc.).
