In this Berzerk-like game you are in a room which is surrounded by several hostile snipers. Just before the snipers shoot at you a door in front of them will open allowing the bullet to pass. It is your task to eleminate the snipers in shooting through the opening doors while your are shot at, dodging the enemies' bullets but still stying to hit your mark. To make matters worse, a monster will respawn randomly in the room you are trapped in whenever you have killed it. After having killed all snipers you move to the next more difficult level.
