SWOOPS! is a collection of three 1K minigames that Thomas Jentzsch (author of Thrust+ Platinum) submitted in the 2004 Minigame Competition. Two of the games in this collection won first and second place in the 1K competition: Cave 1K won the category, and Splatform came in second place. All three of these games offer addicting gameplay that will keep you coming back for me! SWOOPS! contains a menu that allows you to select which game to play, as well as a "3-Athlon" mode that allows you to play all three games in succession.
