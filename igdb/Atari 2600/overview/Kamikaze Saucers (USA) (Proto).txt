Your ship can move left or right but it does not move in a smooth scrolling fashion. Rather, it moves into one of several preset positions. When your ships is in the center of the screen, it fires directly upwards. As it moves towards the left or right, the firing angle adjusts accordingly with the aim point being the top middle of the screen.
