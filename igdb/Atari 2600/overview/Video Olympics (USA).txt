Video Olympics is a collection of games from Atari's popular arcade Pong series. The games are a collection of "bat and ball" style games, including several previously released by Atari as coin-ops in the early 1970s. The games are played using the 2600s paddle controllers, and are for one to four players (three or four players requires a second set of paddle controllers).
