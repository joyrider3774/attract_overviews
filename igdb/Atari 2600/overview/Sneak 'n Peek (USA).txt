Sneak'n Peek is played in and around a spooky old house with a large yard and three weird rooms. Each room, including the yard, is a separate scene: 
- a living room 
- a pink bedroom 
- a blue bedroom 
- the yard 
 
Each scene contains up to five hiding places. That makes a total of twenty 
hiding locations. Some of them are in really strange places, and some of 
the locations can change depending on the level you select.
