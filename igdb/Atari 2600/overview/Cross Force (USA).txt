You are in control of two space ships on opposite sides of the screen. Whenever you fire a shot, the lasers of the two ships will connect across the whole screen and destroy anything that gets caught in the crossfire - except the hostile mothership deploying new enemy fighters. Since your lasers can overheat you should only use controlled bursts of fire and since you can ran out of fuel it is imperative to shoot down the fuel pods as they appear on screen.
