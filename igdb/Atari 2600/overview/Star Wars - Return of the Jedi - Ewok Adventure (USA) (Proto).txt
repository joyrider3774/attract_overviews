Star Wars: Return of the Jedi: Ewok Adventure, also known as Revenge of the Jedi: Game I is a cancelled 1983 shoot 'em up video game based on the Star Wars: Return of the Jedi film. The game was developed by Atari Games and to be published by Parker Brothers on the Atari 2600, Atari 7800, ColecoVision, and Intellivision video game consoles. 
 
Although it was completed, the game was never released for sale, as the marketing department of Parker Brothers considered the controls too difficult to master. A prototype cartridge surfaced in the early 2000s. 
 
In Ewok Adventure, the player takes the role of an Ewok in the hang glider corps with the mission to destroy a shield generator of the Imperial army. The player can control a hang glider with the joystick and has to evade enemies. Depending on the game mode, the player can either make the hang glider climb and decent by pulling back and forth the joystick, or he can reverse the vertical directions. Hitting the ground results in a game over. Furthermore, the player can pick up rocks to drop on enemies when flying over them. 
 
Only one physical copy of Ewok Adventure is currently known to exist. Larry Gelberg, designer of the game, gave the only known prototype of the game to his son in the early 2000s, who later sold the game for $1,680.
