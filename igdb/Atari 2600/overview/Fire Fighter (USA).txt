The objective of the game is to save a person trapped in a burning building. In order to do so you have to extinguish the fire with your fire hose. To complicate matters further the fire will spread to the next floors and you only have a limited water supply. After extinguishing the fire you have to allign the ladder of your fire truck to the floor where the person is on so that he can climb to safety. In subsequnt levels the building has fewer floors resulting in a higher difficulty level.
