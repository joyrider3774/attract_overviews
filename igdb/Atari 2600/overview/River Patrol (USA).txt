As the captain of a boat the player has to rescue as many drowning people in one of the nine rivers as possible while at the same time dodging obstacles like other boats, TNT, the shore, dirftwood etc. There is a time limit to the task since your boat is leaking and will eventually sink. Hitting obstacles like alligators and whirlpools increases the amount of water the boat takes in.
