River Raid II continues the fast-paced shooting action of the 1982 original while adding new features such as varying altitude (the original only featured left and right movement), flying over oceans and firing torpedoes. Now instead of shooting enemy helicopters and planes, you'll also get to bomb destroyers, tanks, buildings, landing strips and water towers in your mission to destroy the enemy bridge.
