"You are in a maze of twisty passages, all alike," certainly describes the situation you are in. You hear faint footsteps, so you follow the sound through the maze. To your horror, you discover the source of the footsteps is a skeleton; and it doesn't look friendly. Acting quickly, you blast it with your undead Disintegrator and the skeleton vanishes in a flash of color, but as you reload your UD, you hear footsteps again; and you wonder; are you the hunter of the hunted in this nightmare?
