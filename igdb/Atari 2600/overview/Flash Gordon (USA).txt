Many dedicated Spacemen have entered Spider City but none has ever been heard from again. It is up to you, Flash Gordon, to rescue any surviving Spacemen and to conquer this hideous city of tunnels. Spider City is conquered when all of its Hatching Pods are eliminated. It doesn't hurt to blast a few Generators or enemy Patrol Ships while you're there.
