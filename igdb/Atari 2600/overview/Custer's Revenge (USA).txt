You are General Custer. Your dander's up, your pistol's wavin‘. You've set your sights on a ravishing maiden named Revenge: but she's not about to take it lying down, by George! Help is on the way. If you're to get to Revenge you'll have to rise to the challenge, dodge a tribe of flying arrows and protect your flanks against some downright mean and prickly cactus. But if you can stand pat and last post the stings and arrows - you can stand last. 
 
Remember! Revenge is sweet. Everytime ol' Custer scores he comes up smilin‘ and right back for more. The higher the score. the more challenging the game action gets.
