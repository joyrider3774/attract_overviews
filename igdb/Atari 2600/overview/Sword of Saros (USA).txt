Work your way through the evil wizard's maze-like dungeon to find the pieces of the Sword of Saros. When you've found all of the pieces, you can exit the dungeon, ending the game. However, the wizard has sent a bat to hunt you down. When the bat finds you, the wizard will teleport to your spot and send waves of skeletons after you. You must avoid the skeletons to reach the wizard and send him off looking for you again. Magical items you find along the way will help you in your quest.
