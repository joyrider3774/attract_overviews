Basic Math (aka Fun With Numbers) is a video game cartridge developed by Atari for its Video Computer System (later known as the Atari 2600). The game was one of the nine launch titles offered when the Atari 2600 went on sale in September 1977. The player's objective is simple: solve basic arithmetic problems. Game variations determine whether the player solves addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division problems, and whether he/she could select the top number (the console randomly selects the lower number). The player uses the joystick to enter a guess, with sound effects signaling whether it is right or wrong.
