Pull! The trap springs, and the clay pegeon -- alive with flight -- soars away from you at an unexpected angle. With a fluid motion, you raise your gun to your shoulder as you pivot toward you target. You lead your pegeon, finger on the trigger...your mind racing...challenged by the speeding target before you. Will your reactions be too slow? Too fast? Or right on course? Suddenly you squeeze the trigger!
