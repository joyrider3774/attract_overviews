Spider Fighter is a Space Invaders style game. It is your mission to prevent space spiders from stealing your food reserves which are located on the top right of the screen. The spiders hatch from cocoons which are dropped from the top left of the screen. Since the spiders are able to attack you, your reactions are tested quite soon as you attempt to dodge the enemies and their bullets while trying to shoot them down. If you you lose all your food reserves or your lifes, it's game over. The enemy moves faster the more progress you make in the game.
