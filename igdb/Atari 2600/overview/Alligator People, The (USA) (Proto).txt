Alligator People is an unreleased prototype based on the movie of the same name. This prototype, discovered by Ben Liashenko, appears to have been completed and unlike some prototypes that never saw the light of day, this one is quite enjoyable to play! You are lost in the deepest part of the jungle. Six of your friends have fallen under the spell of the Alligator People. They are slowly being transformed into alligators and you are the only one in the world who can save them! To stop this transformation, you must inoculate each of them with a special antidote that you gather throughout the swamp. You don't have a lot of time! Not to mention, the alligators are chasing you as you attempt to gather vials of the antidote! The longer you wait, the more antidote you need to reverse the effects of the Alligator People!
