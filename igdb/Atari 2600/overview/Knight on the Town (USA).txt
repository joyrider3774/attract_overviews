The object of the game is to save the lovely princess, held captive in the castle tower, and become the object of her affections in the least possible time. You accomplish this by maneuvering your knight (who's not in shining armor) to build a bridge across the moat, avoiding the dangers of the beast, a crocodile, and in the more difficult version a flying dragon who drops fireballs.
