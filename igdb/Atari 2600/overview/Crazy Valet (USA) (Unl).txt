You have just witnessed an incredible football game in which your home team defeated the visitors by a narrow margin. Little do you realize that your evening's excitement is just beginning. 
 
Being a very important club seat season ticket holder, you had a valet parking pass for the game. Unfortunately, a disgruntled football fan turned valet parking lot attendant took out their frustration at not getting tickets on your car. They spent the entire game in a devious attempt to make it as difficult as possible for you to leave. Now the attendant has left, and you need to assist the other attendants to get your car out of the lot so that you can get home before the post game show is over.
