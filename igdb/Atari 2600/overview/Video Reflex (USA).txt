This game was originally packaged with Video Jogger and the Foot Craz Activity Pad. When a bug appears in one of the boxes, step on it quickly or lose a life. But if a butterfly appears, DON'T step on it or lose a life. You can end up jumping around pretty fast. You can also play this game with a joystick, but it's not as fun.
