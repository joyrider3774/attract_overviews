Sky Diver is an arcade video game designed by Owen Rubin, and released by Atari, Inc. in 1978. Its interface is a simple third-person view of a parachuting drop zone. Sky Diver is a two-player game, although one player can play. The object of Sky Diver is to jump out of a plane, release a parachute and land on the landing pad. To get higher points, the player must release the parachute closer to the ground. The player has nine jumps. If the landing pad is missed, the player loses points. The highest score possible is 99 points (11 points maximum per jump).
