Pilot Star Voyager through treacherous space. As you look out from the Command Bridge, stars rush past. Penetrate the seven star portals and save the Capital Starport. Destroy enemy ships with photon torpedoes or lasers, or evade them to maintain your precious energy supply. 
 
Keep track of energy levels on the instrument panel. Use your radar screen to locate opponents and approaching star portals. Only passing through a star portal restores your energy reserves. But be warned! Crashing into a star portal will destroy you!
