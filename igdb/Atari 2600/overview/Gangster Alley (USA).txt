A gang of gangsters has holed themselves up in an apartment building and taken some hostages. The player has to shoot the gangsters as they slowly creep up behind the windows but at the same time has to avoid shooting any hostages. After the gangsters have appeared completely behind their windows they will shoot back at the player. Therefore the player has to act quickly. The same goes for Nitro Ed who is pacing along the top of the roof and throws hand grenades which will result in instant death, no matter how many lives the players has left.
