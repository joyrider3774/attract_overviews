This game is a port of CBS Electronic’s "Targ" with some minor changes. Besides the different enemy graphics and slightly different sound effects, the screen changes color with each level. Also, most of the bugs present in Targ are absent, and the Spectar (called the 'Warlord’s shuttle' here – all the names have been changed) does appear.
