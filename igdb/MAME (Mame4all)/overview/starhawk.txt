Starhawk is a vector arcade game designed and programmed by Tim Skelly and manufactured by Cinematronics.[1] Starhawk is a shoot 'em up unofficially based on the Star Wars: Episode IV trench run, the first arcade game to blatantly use concepts from Star Wars.[2] The game was unique at the time for its pseudo-3D graphics. It was released for the Vectrex home system in 1982. 
 
The arcade cabinet had to have a cinder block placed inside of it, to prevent it from tipping onto the player.
