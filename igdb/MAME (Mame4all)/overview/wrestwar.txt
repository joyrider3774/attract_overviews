Wrestle War is the name of a video game which was released in the arcades in 1989, and for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis console in 1991 in Japan, Australia, and Europe only. and was published and developed by Sega. Despite being released the same year as the National Wrestling Alliance/World Championship Wrestling's WrestleWar pay-per-view, it is not associated with any wrestling promotion. The original Japanese game cover featured a Hulk Hogan look-alike, with a bandana that spelled "Hogan". It was changed for the European and US releases for royalties reasons.
