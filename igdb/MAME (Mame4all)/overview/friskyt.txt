Frisky Tom is a 1981 arcade game by Nichibutsu. The object of the game is to provide enough water for a shower by crawling along a network of plumbing pipes and picking up/replacing loose pieces. Various types of mice are the game's antagonists, trying to thwart Tom in different ways: knocking pipes loose to disrupt the water flow, jumping down to fall on him, or setting a bomb to blow up the entire plumbing arrangement.
