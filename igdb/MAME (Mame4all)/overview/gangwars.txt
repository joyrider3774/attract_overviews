In Gang Wars, up to two players can control two different characters with different fighting styles. Gang Wars has a control configuration that is composed of two attack buttons (punch and kick), as well a jump button to fight against enemies or overcome obstacles. Players have access to a repertoire of techniques by pushing these buttons individually or in combination. Unlike Double Dragon, Gang Wars has fire arms (much like SNK's P.O.W.: Prisoners of War, except Gang Wars has both an assault rifle and a flamethrower), has a small amount of blood, has cut scenes, has two completely different playable characters and has a feature for customizing three fighting statistics (Power, Speed and Guard) for both players. Players will earn a certain number of points for increasing their fighting statistics.
