The player takes on the role of an officer who must race his squad car through San Francisco in an attempt to win the first ever 'National Championship Police Car Steeplechase'. The gameplay is similar to that of other contemporary racing games, with a two-speed shifter and a chase view. A key difference from other arcade racing games at the time is that the roads have 90-degree turns.[3] It includes sights such as the famous trams and the Golden Gate Bridge. The player can pick from two police cars, one designed for power resembling the Cadillac Brougham, and another designed for handling resembling the Nissan 300ZX Z32.
