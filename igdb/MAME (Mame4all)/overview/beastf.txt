A clone of the Glob. A simple platform game where the player guides Toby (a strange blue "glob") through corridors, up and down the elevators and through the side tunnels in his search for snacks. An assortment of animals relentlessly pursue Toby and fight him for control of the elevators. The player must avoid or stop them and eat a dozen different snacks to clear the 24 levels. A time limit increases the difficulty of the game.
