Designed by Century/Seatongrove, the game was built by Magic Electronics of Cranston, RI and marketed by Montgomery Vending. The game, once again, featured our old friend Quasimodo. Sporting his original green tunic from Hunchback, Quasimodo competed in seven different Olympic events. Priced at $375, the game was also available as a conversion kit for Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Scramble. This is a rip off of track and field.
