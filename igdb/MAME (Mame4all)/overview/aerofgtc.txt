There are eight stages in this game. The beginning stages consists of randomly chosen areas from nations of unselected fighters (assuming those fighters have nations). If Rabio or Lepus is chosen, all four rival nation stages become playable. After completing all rival nation stages, there are four more stages. Player and team-specific endings occur after completing the first loop. After completing the 2nd loop, the ending consists of all pilot pairs giving a speech, with the second pilot in the last pair giving a cheat code.
