Juno First is a top down, vertical scrolling shooter in which there is a limited amount of time to defeat the enemies in each wave. 
 
The players spaceship starts out with a laser that has a longer reach than the enemy weapons. The enemies start out firing a few bullets at the ship but the amount enemy fire rapidly increases as players progress through to the next waves. 
 
Certain enemies fire tracking missile-like projectiles that can shoot additional bullets.
