Guilty Gear Petit (ギルティギア プチ Giruti Gia Puchi?) is the first handheld version of the Guilty Gear series released. It is followed by the sequel Guilty Gear Petit 2. Much like Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix, it depicts the Guilty Gear characters in a super deformed style. It is also notable for the inclusion of the character Fanny, who appears only in the two Guilty Gear Petit games. The game has seven playable characters, six of which are from other Guilty Gear series games. The game was only released in Japan.
