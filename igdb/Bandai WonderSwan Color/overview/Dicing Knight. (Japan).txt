DicingKnight. is a 2004 role-playing video game for the Bandai WonderSwan Color. 
 
DicingKnight. was one of the last WonderSwan games to be released, alongside Judgement Silversword, both winners in the WonderWitch development contest. 
 
The game makes use of all of the WonderSwan's buttons, with A and B allowing the player to use the sword and shield weapons at all times. In addition, the players can assign items to their inventory using the Y buttons. 
 
There was also another version released called Dicing Knight Legion, only for the WonderWitch development system.
