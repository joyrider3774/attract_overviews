Pulseman (パルスマン) (originally known as Spark) is a platform game for the Sega Mega Drive. It was only released on cartridge for a Japanese audience, but was available to North American consumers via the Sega Channel. The game was not sold in Europe. 
 
It was developed by Game Freak, the development team that would later go on to produce the Pokémon series of games for Nintendo. Many of Pulseman's staff, including director Ken Sugimori and composer Junichi Masuda worked on both games.
