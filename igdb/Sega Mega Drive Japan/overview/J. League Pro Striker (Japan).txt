J. League Pro Striker (Ｊリーグプロストライカー) is a 1993 football game for the Sega Mega Drive by Sega. It was the first in a long line of J. League games developed by Sega after acquiring the license to the franchise for their consoles (but it was not the first J. League game on a Sega system — Game Arts's J. League Champion Soccer, released a few months earlier on the MD, was).
