Tel-Tel Stadium (ＴＥＬ・ＴＥＬスタジアム) is a 1990 baseball game by Sunsoft for the Sega Mega Drive. It features Sega Mega Modem support. 
 
The game is a typical baseball game where you are only allowed to control the pitcher and batter — once the ball is hit, you can only watch what the rest of the team does. Pitching is done via a menu of options; swinging the bat is done by hitting A.
