Medal City is a card game for the Sega Mega Drive, released exclusively in Japan in 1991 via the Sega Game Toshokan service. You choose between three gambling games; Poker, Blackjack, and Slots. The goal of each game (besides poker) is to earn over 100,000 medals. You will then see the game's ending (except poker, as the game never ends).
