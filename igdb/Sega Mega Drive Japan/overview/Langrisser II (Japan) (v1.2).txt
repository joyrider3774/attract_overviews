Langrisser II is a turn-based strategy game that was developed by Team Career, part of Masaya, and published by the parent company NCS Corporation. 
 
This version of the game was released on the Nintendo Wii through the Virtual console and was later released for Windows though a classic games service. 
 
Unlike the first Langrisser, known as Warsong internationally, almost all of the other games and remakes in the series have not been released outside of Japan.
