Super Daisenryaku is a 1988 war-simulation game for NEC's PC-88 and PC-98 computers by SystemSoft in their Daisenryaku series of WWII sims. Sega ported it to the Sega Mega Drive in 1989, putting in a new soundtrack supposedly composed by Tokuhiko Uwabo. Not only was it never released outside Japan, but it does not fully implement TMSS, meaning it will only work on early Model 1 Mega Drives.
