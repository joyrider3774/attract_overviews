New 3D Golf Simulation: Waialae no Kiseki (ワイアラエの奇蹟) is a 1991 golf game by T&E Soft for the PC-98 in their New 3D Golf Simulation series that takes place at the Waialae Country Club golf course. T&E ported it to the Sega Mega Drive in 1994 exclusively in Japan (however they released a SNES port overseas as True Golf Classics: Waialae Country Club). Gameplay is identical to that of Pebble Beach Golf Links.
