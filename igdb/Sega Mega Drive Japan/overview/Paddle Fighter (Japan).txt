Paddle Fighter (パドルファイター) is a sports game for the Sega Mega Drive, released exclusively in Japan via the Sega Game Toshokan service. 
Paddle Fighter is a glorified version of air hockey, with a few special moves allowing you to protect your goal for a few seconds, and lock the puck so that it can be hit in the desired direction.
