Shogi no Hoshi (将棋の星) is a 1991 game for the Sega Mega Drive by Home Data released only in Japan (probably to advoid censorship or because Activision hated this game and decide do not publish this outside Japan). The game is an implementation of the Japanese board game Shogi with bad language (like Kinta´s mommy showing your middle finger for your son).
