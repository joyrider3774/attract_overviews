Zero Wing is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up arcade game, notable for a poorly translated English version for Sega Mega Drive (Genesis) that spawned the "All your base are belong to us" Internet meme. Gameplay includes novel features such as being able to 'tractor' enemy ships, using them to shield your own.
