Pro Striker Final Stage (プロストライカー ファイナルステージ) is a 1995 football game by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive made with the J. League license. 
 
Though arguably a "sequel" to J. League Pro Striker, J. League Pro Striker Perfect and J. League Pro Striker 2, Final Stage in fact uses an entirely different engine (most notably, the game is played horizontally rather than vertically) with many more added features.
