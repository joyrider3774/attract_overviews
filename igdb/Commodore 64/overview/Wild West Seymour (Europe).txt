Seymour's second adventure was based around a western he was shooting, and featured him attempting to track down a villain who was attempting to sabotage the movie. The game was divided into four sections, as Seymour visited various American locations in his quest. Other than being in four parts, this game had a similar format to the first, but was somewhat less successful, as it was perceived to be a little too easy.
