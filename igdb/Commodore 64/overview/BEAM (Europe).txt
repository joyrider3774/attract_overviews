In a mysterious, artificial world made up of strange effects, there's only you and your streamline glider. On your journey through 27 levels you're bound to have lots of fun with gravity fields and magnetic fields, etc., but don't go like the devil without a plan or... This game is all about linking energy stations with the help of laser beams, and if you don't plan your strategy carefully, you'll be trapped like a fly in your own energy web. Even if your strategy works, unless your glider (16 directionals) is absolutely under your control, it won't be easy for you to escape from your enemies... the dead stones.
