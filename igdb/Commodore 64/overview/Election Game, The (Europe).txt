A political strategy game based on a General Election in British politics and the aim is for one to four players to get a party (Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats or Independents) into Government. Each player starts with Â£8000 and they must visit as many constituencies from a choice of 60 and canvas for votes. At the start of the game after how many turns are to be played (1 - 120), each player starts at a random constituency and the first player is shown how many people plan to vote for each of the parties. The player then decides how much to spend on their campaign before the next players constituency is shown.
