Crazy Cars 2 is a crazy racing game. You're at the wheel of the fabulous Ferrari F40 and in a race against time in a bid to smash a stolen car racket - the only problem is the guys involved in the racket are corrupt policemen! You go tearing through the states of America in search of the corrupt police, you will also have problems with the honest road cops who don't appreciate the sight of a Ferrari F40 crossing their state at 200 miles per hour...But, it aint that easy! You must plan your route carefully from the maps of each state which are displayed on your screen and which show the actual American freeways that you will travel on. 
 
Be careful, the shortest routes aren't always the easiest as the sight and sound of a blue flashing light will soon make you realize. Your Ferrari is furnished with the latest radar which will enable you to detect Police road blocks which may have been set up to catch you, therefore keep an eye on the freeway junctions as you may be forced to change your route!
