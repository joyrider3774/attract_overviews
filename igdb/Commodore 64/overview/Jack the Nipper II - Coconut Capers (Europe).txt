Following his naughty exploits in Jack the Nipper, Jack and his family have been deported to Australia. Unhappy with this, Jack has jumped from the plane, using his nappy as a parachute. He finds himself in the middle of the African jungle, surrounded by dangerous animals and natives. His father is also following close behind, determined to give his boy a good spanking. Jack must cause as much mischief as possible while avoiding punishment.
