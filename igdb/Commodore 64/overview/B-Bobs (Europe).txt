Behead your way through the levels of a mysterious world ruled by the Wizard Aroon. This game has a nice idea, you have to bump boulders in from below with your helmet on your head, but the gameplay is unfair, in some situations it's just luck, a good idea changed into a frustrating game. Then on the other hand it is easily possible to leech endless score in the bonus round. Not good. Move joystick left/right on title screen to toggle 1/2 player mode.
