A futuristic, fast paced strategy role-playing game by Lord British and Chuckles.

Enter the world of tomorrow, a world of futuristic freeways where the right of way goes to the biggest gun. Somewhere within the 16 cities and outlaw-infested highways of Auto Duel, are the clues you will need to compete the ultimate mission.

Do you have the tactical skills and hair-trigger reactions required of an Auto Duellist? Prove yourself. Step into the arena on Amateur night. Only your driving proficiency and marksmanship can earn you the right to custom build your combat vehicles.

The AADA (American AutoDuel Association) will offer you courier missions for prestige, for money. The FBI and the Underworld will vie for favors, but watch out! You'll quickly realize you need a clone to survive. The final gauntlet will test your AutoDuellist skills.

The challenge of AutoDuel awaits you. Are you ready?
