After a hard days training with the freestyle team at the local dirt 
track, Phil "Pookie" Wheeler, unofficial BMX Ninja, whilst travelling 
home on his bike, a Blackfoot Falcon, was set upon by a rival team, 
the Diamond Backs, whose leader is intent on gaining the ultimate 
street cred. Your title. 
 
You must prove to yourself and your girlfriend that you are capable of 
keeping your title. Should you fail in your task, you will not only 
lose your title, you will lose your girlfriend (who wants to be seen 
with a loser anyway?) and your dignity. Should you succeed, you will 
be rewarded by your girlfriend. Should you complete a certain number 
of areas, you will receive the ultimate reward from her. (We're not 
telling you what it is, so find out yourself if you can.)
