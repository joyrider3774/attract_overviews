The year is 2033. Your name is Tex Murphy, Private Investigator in San Francisco. You've been hired by the beautiful daughter of a university professor to uncover the facts about his death. As you begin your investigation you uncover the deaths of several prominent members of the scientific community. Are these deaths coincidental or is there something more sinister going on?

And which characters could have a motive? Could it be J. Saint Gideon, former head of British Intelligence? Could Frank Schimming, president of the largest surveillance company in the world be hiding something? Or what about Sylvia, the professor's daughter. Is she as innocent as she seems? And why is an infamous Detroit hit man in town?
