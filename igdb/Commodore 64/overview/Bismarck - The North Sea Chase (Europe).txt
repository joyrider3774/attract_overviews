Germany's massive dreadnought, Bismarck, sent Her Majesty's Ship Hood to the bottom of the icy Atlantic on the evening of 24 May 1941. Of the Hood's 1,415 crewmen, only 3 survived. 
 
Bismarck's guns are powerful enough to hurl automobile-sized shells for miles. With such awesome firepower, can she invincibly prowl the sea lanes? Can Britain stop her? 
 
Bismarck- The North Sea Chase is a taut, multi-level game featuring full joystick control; real-time action; and variable speed and difficulty levels.
