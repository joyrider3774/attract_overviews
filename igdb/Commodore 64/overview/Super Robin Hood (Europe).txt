You will need skill and quick reflexes to survive in the dangerous 
castle complex. Watch out for the guards who shoot bolts at you with their 
crossbows, you can duck or jump to avoid them, or even run away. If you get 
hit you will lose vital HEALTH points. These start at 99 and if they fall 
below 00 you are a dead man! There are tablets lying around which will 
increase your HEALTH points if you can get them. 
 
You must collect all the hearts around the castle and then go to the 
East Tower to save Maid Marian. However, to make progress through the castle 
you have to get the keys needed to operate the mechanical mediaeval lifts 
which elevate you to different sections of the castle.
