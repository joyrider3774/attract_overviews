Hercules is a game for the Sega Mega Drive, and a hack of Dahna: Megami Tanjou. The game was released in 1997 by an unknown company. 
It is unknown what, if any, was changed beyond the initial title screen. However, it seems to be the reason that the unlicensed original platformer released afterwards was referred to as "Hercules 2" for the Mega Drive
