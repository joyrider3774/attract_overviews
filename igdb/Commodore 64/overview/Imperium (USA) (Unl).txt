Oil Imperium is an Oil business strategic game. Every player has one month for dealing. He can buy or sell oilfields and storage tanks, offer oil on the world's markets, obtain statistics and studies, use sabotage, employ detectives, drill for oil, lay pipelines and much more. Once the month has ended the next player begins his turn. When all the players have completed their deals, a graphical description in column form, showing the financial status of each company will appear.
