You are racing in the world's craziest race: 
 
"The American Cross Country Prestige Cars Race" 
 
This race is over three tracks throughout the United States: Arizona, Space Shuttle, and Florida. If you are able to complete the race before the time runs out, you will get a faster car. You start with a Mercedes 560 SEC, then a Porsche 911 Turbo. Better than average drivers will receive a Lamborghini Countach, and only the world's best drivers may drive a Ferrari GTO. 
 
Prepare to start. Ready? Go!
