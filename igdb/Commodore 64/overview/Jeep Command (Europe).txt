Can you make it back to base through unchartered enemy territory? You can speed up or slow down and the faster you go the higher you jump. You have guns on the front and rear of the Jeep to explode enemy grenades and mega firebombs. Use the ramps to travel on the upper platforms. You must negotiate the long cavern avoiding the roof and grenades.
