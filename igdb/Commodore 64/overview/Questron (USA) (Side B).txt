In this role-playing game, the player begins as a peasant whose land is under attack by monsters. After killing one, a princess names the peasant champion, and issues a quest, to rid the country of enemies. She can provide no map, but says that part of the quest involves learning the layout of the land by traveling it...and so the game begins.
