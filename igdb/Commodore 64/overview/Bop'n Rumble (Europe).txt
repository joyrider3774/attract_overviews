In Bop N' Wrestle, players take the role of wrestler Gorgeous George who finds he is the only one in the position to clean the mean streets from various thugs and loonies. 
 
Gameplay involves walking through the streets and taking out any enemies that get in the way. Kicks and punches are your basic moves at first, but as the game progresses, new moves and attacks become available, and new enemy types to beat up as well.
