Something very bizarre has happened in the fairy village. What has happened to change the inhabitants from chummy chappies into fluffy fiends? They've only gone and kidnapped the beloved Mom of our angelic fairy heroes, Tam and Rit. She now lies captured in the top of the Maboots Tower waiting to be rescued. There's only one thing for it: Tam and Rit must put on the Rainbow shoes given to them by the Elder, and armed with the rods of Sheesanomo, a gift from their Dad, must go and wop anything that moves on the head!
