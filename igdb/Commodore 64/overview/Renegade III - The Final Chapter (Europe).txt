Renegade 3: The Final Chapter is a scrolling beat'em up computer game released on the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MSX and ZX Spectrum systems in the late 1980s by Ocean Software under their "Imagine" label. The game is a sequel to Target: Renegade which itself is a sequel to the arcade game Renegade. 
 
Unlike the first two games, Renegade 3 follows the character known only as "Renegade" as he travels through time to rescue his captured girlfriend. It also dropped the two-player mode found in the previous title.
