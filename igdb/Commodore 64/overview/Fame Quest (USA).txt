A friendly joust of duel to the death? Kill the dragon, run away or even talk to it? 
 
These are some of the questions you will have to answer on your Fame Quest. You enter this world as a lowly knight without sword or armour. By means of your skill and judgement you will accumulate fame (and money!). Given time you may aspire to be the mightiest warrior in the land, but beware - many encounters await you on your Quest.
