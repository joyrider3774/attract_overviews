Once upon a rainbow in a land at clouds and sky, a great misfortune occurred. One night. while the inhabitants slept someone stole the colors of the rainbow. The next morning, when the terrible deed was discovered, a great sorrow settled over the land. 
 
No longer did people go merrily gallumping about. No longer did minstrels sing the happy songs of the realm. And worst at all. not a single smile could be found on the faces of the children. They all stayed in the shadows listlessly mumbling to themselves. 
 
Only the wizard of the royal court was not hopeless. For in reading the ancient text, he discovered the spell of the magical, musical. shoes. When the King was told the colors might be restored through this spell. he sent for Cedrick. his bravest subject. 
When Cedrick put on the magic shoes. wherever he stepped. color and music burst forth. Armed With the shoes. Cedrick went to the tippity, toppity most cloud and saw where the darkened rainbow was and. with a mighty hop. launched himself upon it. Now this task was not for the taint of heart for there were borbuls, whirling devils, gruebirds. and all sorts of other nasties that were happy the rainbow was dark. and there were great gaps in the rainbow to fall through. 
 
And this is how Cedrick began. The rest of the story, however, dear player. is up to you. For through the wizard's magic. Cedrick the rainbow walker lives inside you.
