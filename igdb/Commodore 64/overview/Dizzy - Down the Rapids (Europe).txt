Dizzy Down the Rapids is an arcade style action video game that was published in 1991 by Codemasters for the Amstrad CPC, Spectrum, DOS, Atari ST, Commodore 64 and Amiga. The game involves Dizzy riding barrels down a river avoiding obstacles and enemies. This was another game derived from a minigame game found in The Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy like Bubble Dizzy. The game was based on the game play from an arcade game titled Toobin'. The C64 version was developed first by Paul Black. The C64 version was originally a clone of Toobin called 'Toobin Turles'. When the game was taken to Codemasters for consideration, it was rebranded to take advantage of the Dizzy character.
