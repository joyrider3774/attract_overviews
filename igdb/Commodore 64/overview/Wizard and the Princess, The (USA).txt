Princess Priscilla has been kidnapped and the player seems to be the only valliant hero willing to rescue the damsel in distress. This is the second text adventure with illustrating graphics released by Sierra. Communicating with the game works via entering commands which tell the player's alter ego where to go and what to do. Since the parser is a very basic one it only understands two-word commands. Two years after its initial release, the game was renamed "Adventure in Serenia" for its PC release. This suggested sequel was, however, exactly the same game as in its previous incarnation.
