You are from the planet Choom in the Thwok solar system, which is under threat from a group of seven crazed dictators and their intergalactic war. Can you fight them all off in this fusion of side-scrolling shooting and top-view fighting? 
 
First you fly along the planet's surface and atmosphere, complete with jetpack, shooting out enemies as they fly around you, and avoiding contact with them. You'll have to find planetbusters to gain access to the bunkers which contain nerve centres.
