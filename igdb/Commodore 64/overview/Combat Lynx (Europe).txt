This is probably the most comprehensive 'real-time' battle simulation program 
ever written for a home computer. It can be played on a simple level as a 
'shoot-them-up' game, or a more stealthy player can make use of the 
intelligence map to locate and destroy selected targets. The most skilled 
players will be able to protect their bases with mines, support forward bases 
under attack with air cover and fresh troops, and also intercept and destroy 
enemy vehicles (land and air) while in flight between bases. A game could 
last five seconds or five hours depending on the dexterity and tactical skill 
of the player.
