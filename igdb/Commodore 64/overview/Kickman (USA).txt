In Kickman, you are a unicycle riding clown! Your job? Catch all the balloons on your head, without dropping any. Kickman was originally released as simply "Kick." Later versions of the game came with a "Kickman" marquee, presumably in an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Pac-Man, who appeared in the game.
