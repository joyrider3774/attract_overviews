Welcome to the official Advanced Dungeons & Dragons computer product, Curse of the Azure Bonds, A Forgotten Realms fantasy role-playing epic. This adventure game is based on the rules and background created by TSR, Inc. and a storyline created especially for this game. THE CURSE OF THE AZURE BONDS adventure begins in the frontier city of Tilverton on the border between the great kingdom of Cormyr and the scattered settlements of the Dalelands. The characters begin as experienced adventurers who have been ambushed, captured, and cursed with five magical bonds. 
 
Each bond is an azure-blue symbol imprinted just under the skin of each character's swordarm. These bonds have dangerous magical powers that can take control of the characters' actions. The characters' quest in Curse of the Azure Bonds is to search the Realms for the source of the bonds and rid themselves of the bonds' terrible curse.
