You are "Lone Wolf" with your turbo Sherman tank in pursuit 
of the "Desert Fox", Nazi Germany's Rommel forces in the 
Lybian desert. 
 
How to win: Save all your depots 
How to lose: Either your tank damage gauge is full or your 
 depots fall to the enemy 
 
How to save your depots: 
 
1. Zoom 
Select ZOOM icon and press the fire button. When it turns from 
red to green move the joystick, this will move the black box on 
the map from depot to depot. 
 
Allies depots indicated by gray flags: 
saved depots turn blue, 
lost depots turn red. 
 
With zoom icon green, press fire button. Depot status will zoom 
up to reveal the number of tanks (red=enemy, blue=allies), fuel 
(oil drums) and supplies (tents). These supplies/fuel will be 
used by 'Lone Wolf' to repair and refuel his tank (decrease 
damage gauge). 
 
Number in lower right hand corner equals hours remaining before 
depot will fall. 
 
2, Radio 
Lone Wolf's heading is determined by selecting the RADIO icon. 
When icon turns green, push joystick right or left to move radio 
beacon. Press fire button again to activate Lone Wolf's secret 
enigma decoder. This special radio device intercepts Rommel's 
orders. The first word the player hears indicates the type of 
enemy force; for example "stukas", "minefields", etc., directly 
ahead. Later words indicate outlying enemy positions. 
 
Through careful selection of the radio beacon heading, Lone Wolf 
can thread his way through enemy forces to rescue his besieged 
depots. 
 
Strategy Tip: Listen for radio static. Static indicates no enemy 
forces in an immediate area. Avoid confrontation whenever 
possible and head for the wide open spaces. (The shortest 
distance between 2 points is not always a straight line.) 
 
3. Air Strike 
When a depot is in danger of being wiped out (their status should 
be checked throughout the game) and Lone Wolf is too far away for 
a rescue mission, call in a spitfire airstrike to buy time. 
 
Highlight the AIRSTRIKE icon in green (using fire button). 
When arrow appears at a depot, move joystick until the correct 
depot has been selected. Press fire button and air strike will 
begin. If you choose not to send in an air strike, simply cycle 
the arrow through all depots and the airstrike icon will 
turn red again. 
 
NOTE: it takes time for air strike to reach its destination. 
Lone Wolf only has "one" air strike per game. 
 
4. Swastika 
Indicates location of Rommel who pursues Lone Wolf around the 
map. Once the Desert Fox is
