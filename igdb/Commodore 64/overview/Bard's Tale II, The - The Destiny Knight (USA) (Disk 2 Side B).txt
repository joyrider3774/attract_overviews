When the going gets even tougher... 
 
Another wolf! Your magic sword cleaves him mid snarl, and he drops in a fur pile at your feet. There's a slime ball conjurer just out of reach who'll keep summoning these slobbering missiles until your sword arm drops off. Unless you can figure out a way to get at him. 
 
When you put Mangar out to pasture, all you really wanted was a bottomless mug and an ace up your sleeve. So what are you doing out here in the gnarly wilderness, knee deep in wolf meat, itching to put an arrow through the Adam's apple of some spell caster? 
 
It must be your destiny. 
 
Between the six cities lies an immense wilderness. It's a mapping challenge never before seen in a fantasy game, and a whole new way to get lost.
