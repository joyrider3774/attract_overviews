Relive the daring exploits of Roger the Dodger through his prodigy Slippery Sid. More skill, more nerve, this cool little character seeks not only to follow in his famous parent's footsteps, but to establish some amazing feats of his own. 
Money's not his game. Espionage is his middle name and having forced his way into the National Securitys HQ he's faced with a no return journey through one of the most dangerous, most complex buildings in the land. Can he successfully complete a nerve tingling search for the golden keys - his only means of escape - or this time has his skill and daring taken him to far. Watch out for those weird killer security guards - you never what chilling surprises the mad scientists have produced - and beware the floor doesn't disappear from under your feet, sending you to an early grave. You polished up your skills on Blagger now put them to test on his son.
