Once, in a tavern on the waterfront, an old salt whispered to you the tale of the Seven Bishops -- Christian men who had been blown far off course into an unknown realm and who established seven Kingdoms whose splendor ranked with the reign of Solomon. Since that time you have dreamed of little else.

Now at long last you have been granted the resources necessary to mount an expedition. To be sure, the Court's ministers are interested only in surpassing Portugal's maritime strength and controlling commerce to and from the Orient. They do not know of your real motives. But no matter. The expedition is yours to command, and you feel certain that adventure beyond all imagining, and riches beyond all dreams of avarice, are in your grasp.
