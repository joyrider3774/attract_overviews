I am Doctor Victor Frankenstein. I believed... Oh foolish man! I believed I could equal the wonders of God. For I, in my researches had discovered the secret of life! For two wearisome years I experimented with my secrets of life force. Long hours spent in the laboratory tolling over bloddy tissue. Re-animating dead animal muscle: Notes, experiments, more notes, adjustments to my apparatus. 
My experiments became an obsession! I forgot about food, my body became wasted. My eyes stared wildly from sunken sockets. 
Friends had deserted me, considering me eccentric, I did not care! For I was destined to stand among the gods! Their equal, a creator... A giver of life itself!
