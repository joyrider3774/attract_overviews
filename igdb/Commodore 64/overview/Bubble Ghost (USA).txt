The crazy inventor Heinrich Von Schinker is dead. Or so we thought until the nightwatchman told us his fantastic tale of the haunting of Von Schtinker's old castle. Yes it has been confirmed. Heinrichs' sprit (a.k.a. Bubble Ghost) has been blowing a bubble throughout the macarbe halls of his ancestral home. Your job is to help Bubble Ghost move the bubble through the 35 rooms of the castle, past all the mad inventions of Von Schtinker. Once the little ghostie makes it through, the haunting will cease.
