One to four players can compete in Match or Tournament Play, with individual handicaps. Wind, temperature and ground condition can be entered or randomly determined by the computer. When playing, the left half of the screen shows the situation from the player's point of view, and the right half shows a map of the course. The player can select between different clubs. For each shot, you can individually select the direction, the angle of attack, and the spin. The strength of the shot must be carefully timed.
