Cybotron is a single screen shooter viewed from a high elevated angle and is inspired by the arcade game Robotron 2084, in which you must destroy all robots on the screen to move to the next level. If you touch any robot then you lose one of three lives but you are armed with a laser. Two joysticks can be selected with one controlling your movements while the other joystick controls your fire direction. Humans also wander around the screen and these can be collected for bonus points.
