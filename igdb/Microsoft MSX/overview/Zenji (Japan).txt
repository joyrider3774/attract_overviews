Let us call the "Many" the "Elements." Then let us see that in the vast blackness, beyond the beyond, the Elements assemble around the Source. Some are connected, some are not. Those united with the Source are green with energy, while the disconnected ones are an empty grey. The seeker must connect the Many to the One, thus turning all the Elements green with the power of the Source. In that instant, Zenji occurs.
