Kingâ€™s Valley is a platform/maze game from Konami, released for the MSX computer and MS-DOS in 1985. The game plays is like Lode Runner except it takes place in pyramids instead of Egyptian ruins. As an intrepid adventurer, the player's goal is to collect various gems, while evading angry mummies and other monsters long enough to find the exit to the next level. 
 
A port to MS-DOS was made by a Korean company named APROMAN, however it only supports monochrome and CGA graphic cards. Another unofficial port has been released by the Spanish RetroWorks [1] in 2009 for the ZX Spectrum on the site 'World Of Spectrum'[2]. 
 
The MSX version of this game can still be run with emulators like BlueMSX [3]. Emulators for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum are available at WOS. 
 
King's Valley had been rewritten (not ported or emulated) in 2008 using Java, Online version is playable over internet using the web-browser and Mobile version is downloadable for handhelds, mobiles and communicators with Java installed for personal use [4].
