The player controls a formula one race car whose objective is to advance through the rankings and either make the best time or accumulate as many points as possible depending on the game selected. 
 
In Game 1, the player has unlimited cars and their goal is to finish the course in as little time as possible. In Game 2, the player receives 5 cars and the goal is to accumulate as many points as possible. 
 
In both games, collision with either the edge of the track or other cars results in the loss of a life and the player is forced to start from a speed of zero.
