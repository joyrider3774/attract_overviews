The evil Spud has taken Spike's girl, Molly, and Spike must make his way through various levels on platforms and ladders to rescue Molly. You must move the ladder from platform to platform and jump gaps to retrieve the key that will set Molly free from her cage. But be careful, Spud has evil bounces and birds he has sent out after you! You can defend yourself by kicking right or left. 
 
You can play either one player or two player mode where each player takes a turn with a single joystick controller. Who will save the fair Molly first and win her affection?
