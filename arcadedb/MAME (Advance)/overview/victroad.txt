- TRIVIA -

Released in October 1986 in USA and EUROPE. In this Export release, the voices were changed to speak English dialogue. For example, upon starting the game the player would be greeted by a giant floating head who would exclaim, "Warriors! Show some guts! You can't escape me! Come get me if you can! Ha ha ha ha haa!" At this point the floating head would fly off screen and the gameplay commenced. After the player loses a life, one would hear "Come on, let's fight!" upon returning to the game.
