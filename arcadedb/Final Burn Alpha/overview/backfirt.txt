Arcade Video game published 32 years ago:

Back Fire (c) 1988 Tecmo.

A standard horizontal shoot'em up. The main weapon can be powered-up to provide faster and more powerful shots. Weapons such as lightning or three-way shots appear as power-ups. There are 18 levels to complete the game. If you use a credit to continue in levels 14 through 18, you will start back at level 13.

- TRIVIA -

This game is a prototype or had a limited release.

The background graphics were re-used in "Silkworm". For the little story, Tecmo showed its games at the AM Show in 1987 and Back Fire wasn't a success. So, they changed to "Silkworm".
