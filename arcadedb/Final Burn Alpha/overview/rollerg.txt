- TRIVIA -

In the original Japanese Version, during the game, there are some power-ups (the icons resemble the Rollergames logo) which will pop up on either the left or right side of the screen which can give the player certain abilities:
Red: Speeds up the Jetter (either a human or a CPU player)
Yellow: Allows the Jetter to do a temporary hurricane spin kick
Green: Temporarily freezes the opponents (including the jetter)
In addition to these powerups, if a human player collects 3 blue rollergames logos, that player can earn an extra life.

These original features were removed in the export releases.
