Newpuc2 (c) 1980 Kamiya.

- TRIVIA -

Newpuc2 is a hack of "PuckMan". It has:
* Intermissions from the original "PuckMan" between each maze.
* A 'slot machine' every 3 mazes which determines which type of maze (invisible/visible) will come up next.
* There are two maze variants:
The first is a visible blue maze with five exits on each side and a modified maze layout from the original "PuckMan".
The second maze is invisible except for the borders and the dots, but has a slightly different layout than the visible maze and has only three exits on each side.
* When a power pill is eaten, the ghosts turn into different looking monsters.
* The 'GAME OVER' message displays something different (see Updates below).
