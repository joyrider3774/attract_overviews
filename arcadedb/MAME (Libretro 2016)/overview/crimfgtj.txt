- TRIVIA -

In this version:
* Reverse kick removed. This is now a 2-button game (punch & kick) instead of 3 in the original version.
* Character's energy is represented by a numerical hit point value which is always on countdown to zero. Additional hit points may be added by inserting more coins into each player's corresponding coin slot.
* Characters can use a reversal kick which is automatically activated if an opponent is behind you as you press the kick button. This kick knocks down enemies (except bosses) with a single hit!
* The gun has limited ammo, however it is possible to pick it up again if an enemy knocks it off your hand. Also each gunshot is as strong as 3 punches or kicks and knocks down most enemies in one shot.
* You can play the extra stage (enemy boss revenge) more than once.
* Original Timer and Credit Counter removed.
