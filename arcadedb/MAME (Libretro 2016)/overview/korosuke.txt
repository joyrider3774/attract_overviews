- TRIVIA -

This game is also known as "Crush Roller". For more information about the game, please see the "Crush Roller" entry. 

This version of the game adds a button to teleport to a random spot on the board - restricted to a spot that has already been painted.

For a period of time the yellow blog will clean up what you've lain down on the streets. That time only lasts a few seconds at first (longer as you finish off more racks), but will leave you with more stuff to paint over.
