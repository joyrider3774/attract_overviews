Arcade Video game published 31 years ago:

Jumping (c) 1989 Seyutu Electronics.

Bootleg of "Rainbow Islands - The Story of Bubble Bobble 2".

The main character has been redrawn, as well as the rainbow, the title screen and several other things.

The sound is slightly different because this bootleg board uses two YM2203 sound processors, while the original game uses a single YM2151.

- TRIVIA -

Bugs: the bootleggers didn't defeat the protection completely: secret rooms are broken, some dying enemy sprites have obviously wrong graphics, monsters are falling through platforms etc.
