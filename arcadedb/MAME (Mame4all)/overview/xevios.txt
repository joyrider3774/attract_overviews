- TRIVIA -

The titlescreen says '1980' but the game was certainly released in 1983.

- TIPS AND TRICKS -

* Secret Message: The bootlegger has included the trick for generating a message right at the beginning of the game. When Solvalou appears, move to the right edge of the screen, wait a few seconds and drop a single bomb as soon as the music changes (after the long note). The message 'Dead copy making copy under Namco program.' will appear on the screen.
