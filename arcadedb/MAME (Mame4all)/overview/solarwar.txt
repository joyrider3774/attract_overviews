Originally to be called 'Super Man' but the licensing deal fell through and they needed another name to fit the 5.3 pattern (because of the drop targets). Another 5.3 name briefly used for the game was 'Orion XIV but a 'comp' plex with that name being made. It may still be out there somehwere...

Only five of these games and 300 kits were produced (who were sold to a Greek distributor/operator).
