Egg Venture Deluxe (c) 1997 The Game Room.

- TRIVIA -

This deluxe version has an ending, when you complete the tour, but the Dynamic Play Adjustment has a serious bug. The game encodes the number of successful completions and uses this to alter the difficulty. However, the number seems to decrease rather than increase at first, giving a difficulty multiplier of -1 after a few rounds. This makes the following level (Factory Eggs) incredibly difficult until you lose a couple of lives.
