# attract overviews
Overview files for attractmode frontend from different sources mostly linked against hyperpie lists which in itselve probably used hyperspin lists
* arcadedb is good for mame games but it has texts like "game released XX years ago" which is not handy if you don't want to rescrape every year. It also contains "edit this entry <url>" entries 
* screenscraperfr is probably your best choise as it used crc matching before filename matching
* igdb is also good but much less info found and they did not differentiate between platforms according to skyscraper so you might end up with same descriptions across platforms or even mismatches
* worldofspectrum is sinclair zx spectrum only
